religious than the Hebrews. They have perhaps a purer,
more independent and impersonal knowledge of God.
Their religious books describe the first inquisitive and
contemplative access to God; the Hebrew bible a conscientious
return, a grosser and more personal repentance.
Repentance is not a free and fair highway to
God. A wise man will dispense with repentance. It is
shocking and passionate. God prefers that you approach
him thoughtful, not penitent, though you are the chief
of sinners. It is only by forgetting yourself that you
draw near to him.

The calmness and gentleness with which the Hindoo
philosophers approach and discourse on forbidden
themes is admirable.

What extracts from the Vedas I have read fall on me

purity, physical, intellectual, and moral, is open.

I do not prefer one religion or philosophy to another.
I have no sympathy with the bigotry and ignorance
which make transient and partial and puerile distinctions
between one man’s faith or form of faith and
another’s,—as Christian and heathen. I pray to be
delivered from narrowness, partiality, exaggeration,
bigotry. To the philosopher all sects, all nations, are
alike. I like Brahma, Hari, Buddha, the Great Spirit,
as well as God.

Shoes are commonly too narrow. If you should take
off a gentleman’s shoes, you would find that his foot
was wider than his shoe. Think of his wearing such an
engine! walking in it many miles year after year! A
shoe which presses against the sides of the foot is to be
condemned. To compress the foot like the Chinese is as
bad as to compress the head like the Flatheads, for the
head and the foot are one body. The narrow feet,—they
greet each other on the two sides of the Pacific. A
sensible man will not follow fashion in this respect, but
reason. Better moccasins, or sandals, or even bare feet,
than a tight shoe. A wise man will wear a shoe wide
and large enough, shaped somewhat like the foot, and
tied with a leather string, and so go his way in peace,
letting his foot fall at every step.

Sunday, May 12, 1850, visited the site of the Dustin
house in the northwest part of Haverhill, now but a slight
indentation in a corn-field, three or four feet deep, with
an occasional brick and cellar-stone turned up in plowing.
The owner, Dick Kimball, made much of the corn
grown in this hole, some ears of which were sent to
Philadelphia. The apple tree which is said to have stood
north from the house at a considerable distance is gone.
A brick house occupied by a descendant is visible from
the spot, and there are old cellar-holes in the neighborhood,
probably the sites of some of the other eight
houses which were burned on that day. It is a question
with some which is the site of the true Dustin house.
</p>

<p>
Also visited the same day an ancient garrison-house
now occupied by Fred. Ayer, who said it was built one
hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty years ago
by one Emerson, and that several oxen were killed by
lightning while it was building. There was also a pear
tree nearly as old as the house. It was built of larger
and thicker and harder brick than are used nowadays,
and on the whole looked more durable and still likely to
stand a hundred years. The hard burnt blue-black ends
of some of the bricks were so arranged as to checker
the outside. He said it was considered the handsomest
house in Haverhill when it was built, and people used
to come up from town some two miles to see it. He
thought that they were the original doors which we saw.
There were but few windows, and most of them were
about two feet and a half long and a foot or more wide,
only to fire out of. The oven originally projected outside.
There were two large fireplaces. I walked into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
one, by stooping slightly, and looked up at the sky.
Ayer said jokingly that some said they were so made
to shoot wild geese as they flew over. The chains and
hooks were suspended from a wooden bar high in the
chimney. The timbers were of immense size.

Jewett’s steam mill is profitable, because the planing
machine alone, while that is running, makes shavings
and waste enough to feed the engine, to say nothing of
the sawdust from the sawmill; and the engine had not
required the least repair for several years. Perhaps, as
there is not so much sawing and planing to be done in
England, they therefore may not find steam so cheap as
water.

In all my rambles I have seen no landscape which can
make me forget Fair Haven. I still sit on its Cliff in a
new spring day, and look over the awakening woods and
the river, and hear the new birds sing, with the same
delight as ever. It is as sweet a mystery to me as ever,
what this world is. Fair Haven Lake in the south, with
its pine-covered island and its meadows, the hickories
putting out fresh young yellowish leaves, and the oaks
light-grayish ones, while the oven-bird thrums his
sawyer-like strain, and the chewink rustles through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
dry leaves or repeats his jingle on a tree-top, and the
wood thrush, the genius of the wood, whistles for the
first time his clear and thrilling strain,—it sounds as it
did the first time I heard it. The sight of these budding
woods intoxicates me,—this diet drink.

In the row of buttonwood trees on the banks of the
Merrimack in Haverhill, I saw that several had been cut
down, probably because of their unsightly appearance,
they all suffering from the prevalent disease which has
attacked the buttonwood of late years, and one large one
still resting on its stump where it had fallen. It seemed
like a waste of timber or of fuel, but when I inquired
about it, they answered that the millers did not like to
saw it. Like other ornamental trees which have stood
by the roadside for a hundred years, the inhabitants
have been accustomed to fasten their horses to them,
and have driven many spikes into them for this purpose.
One man, having carried some buttonwood logs to mill,
the miller agreed to saw them if he would make good the
injury which might be done to his saw. The other agreed
to it, but almost at the first clip they ran on to a spike and
broke the saw, and the owner of the logs cried, “Stop!”
he would have no more sawed. They are difficult to split,
beside, and make poor timber at best, being very liable
to warp.

Nothing memorable was ever accomplished in a
prosaic mood of mind. The heroes and discoverers
have found true more than was previously believed,

Referred to the world’s standard, the hero, the discoverer,

of Columbus approaching the New World: “The
grateful coolness of the evening air, the ethereal purity
of the starry firmament, the balmy fragrance of flowers,
wafted to him by the land breeze, all led him to suppose
(as we are told by Herrera, in the Decades (5)),
that he was approaching the garden of Eden, the sacred
abode of our first parents. The Orinoco seemed to him
one of the four rivers which, according to the venerable
tradition of the ancient world, flowed from Paradise,
to water and divide the surface of the earth, newly
adorned with plants.”

I have been surprised to discover the amount and
the various kinds of life which a single shallow swamp
will sustain. On the south side of the pond, not more
than a quarter of a mile from it, is a small meadow of
ten or a dozen acres in the woods, considerably lower
than Walden, and which by some is thought to be fed by
the former by a subterranean outlet,—which is very
likely, for its shores are quite springy and its supply of
water is abundant and unfailing,—indeed tradition
says that a sawmill once stood over its outlet, though
its whole extent, including its sources, is not more than
I have mentioned,—a meadow through which the
Fitchburg Railroad passes by a very high causeway,
which required many a carload of sand, where the
laborers for a long time seemed to make no progress,
for the sand settled so much in the night that by morning
they were where they were the day before, and
finally the weight of the sand forced upward the adjacent
crust of the meadow with the trees on it many
feet, and cracked it for some rods around. It is a
wet and springy place throughout the summer, with
a ditch-like channel, and in one part water stands the
year round, with cat-o’-nine-tails and tussocks and
muskrats’ cabins rising above it, where good cranberries
may be raked if you are careful to anticipate
the frost which visits this cool hollow unexpectedly
early. Well, as I was saying, I heard a splashing in the
shallow and muddy water and stood awhile to observe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
the cause of it. Again and again I heard and saw the
commotion, but could not guess the cause of it,—what
kind of life had its residence in that insignificant pool.
We sat down on the hillside. Ere long a muskrat came
swimming by as if attracted by the same disturbance,
and then another and another, till three had passed, and
I began to suspect that they were at the bottom of it.
Still ever and anon I observed the same commotion in
the waters over the same spot, and at length I observed
the snout of some creature slyly raised above the surface
after each commotion, as if to see if it were observed
by foes, and then but a few rods distant I saw another
snout above the water and began to divine the cause of
the disturbance. Putting off my shoes and stockings,
I crept stealthily down the hill and waded out slowly
and noiselessly about a rod from the firm land, keeping
behind the tussocks, till I stood behind the tussock
near which I had observed the splashing. Then, suddenly
stooping over it, I saw through the shallow but
muddy water that there was a mud turtle there, and
thrusting in my hand at once caught him by the claw,
and, quicker than I can tell it, heaved him high and
dry ashore; and there came out with him a large pout
just dead and partly devoured, which he held in his
jaws. It was the pout in his flurry and the turtle in
his struggles to hold him fast which had created the
commotion. There he had lain, probably buried in the
mud at the bottom up to his eyes, till the pout came
sailing over, and then this musky lagune had put forth
in the direction of his ventral fins, expanding suddenly
under the influence of a more than vernal heat,—there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
are sermons in stones, aye and mud turtles at the bottoms
of the pools,—in the direction of his ventral fins,
his tender white belly, where he kept no eye; and the
minister squeaked his last.<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> Oh, what an eye was there,
my countrymen! buried in mud up to the lids, meditating
on what? sleepless at the bottom of the pool, at
the top of the bottom, directed heavenward, in no danger
from motes. Pouts expect their foes not from below.
Suddenly a mud volcano swallowed him up, seized
his midriff; he fell into those relentless jaws from which
there is no escape, which relax not their hold even in
death.<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> There the pout might calculate on remaining
until nine days after the head was cut off. Sculled
through Heywood’s shallow meadow, not thinking of
foes, looking through the water up into the sky. I saw
his [the turtle’s] brother sunning and airing his broad
back like a ship bottom up which had been scuttled,—foundered
at sea. I had no idea that there was so
much going on in Heywood’s meadow.

The pickerel commonly lie perfectly still at night,
like sticks, in very shallow water near the shore near
a brook’s mouth. I have seen a large one with a deep
white wound from a spear, cutting him half in two,
unhealed and unhealable, fast asleep, and forked him
into my boat. I have struck a pickerel sound asleep
and knew that I cut him almost in two, and the next
moment heard him go ashore several rods off; for
being thus awakened in their dreams they shoot off
with one impulse, intending only to abandon those
parts, without considering exactly to what places they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
shall go. One night a small pickerel, which the boat
had probably struck in his sleep, leaped into the boat

I was as interested in the discovery of limestone as
if it had been gold, and wondered that I had never
thought of it before. Now all things seemed to radiate
round limestone, and I saw how the farmers lived near
to, or far from, a locality of limestone. I detected it
sometimes in walls, and surmised from what parts it
was probably carted; or when I looked down into an
old deserted well, I detected it in the wall, and found
where the first settlers had quarried it extensively. I
read a new page in the history of these parts in the
old limestone quarries and kilns where the old settlers
found the materials of their houses; and I considered
that, since it was found so profitable even at Thomaston
to burn lime with coal dust, perchance these quarries
might be worked again.<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>

We are never prepared to believe that our ancestors
lifted large stones or built thick walls. I find that I must
have supposed that they built their bank walls of such
as a single man could handle. For since we have put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
their lives behind us we can think of no sufficient motive
for such exertion. How can their works be so visible
and permanent and themselves so transient? When I
see a stone which it must have taken many yoke of
oxen to move, lying in a bank wall which was built two
hundred years ago, I am curiously surprised, because
it suggests an energy and force of which we have no
memorials. Where are the traces of the corresponding
moral and intellectual energy? I am not prepared to
believe that a man lived here so long ago who could elevate
into a wall and properly aline a rock of great size
and fix it securely,—such an Archimedes. I walk over
the old corn-fields, it is true, where the grassy corn-hills
still appear in the woods, but there are no such traces
of them there. Again, we are wont to think that our ancestors
were all stalwart men, because only their most
enduring works have come down to us. I think that the
man who lifted so large a rock in the course of his
ordinary work should have had a still larger for his
monument.

I noticed a singular instance of ventriloquism to-day

It was difficult to believe that the last part of his strain,

was not the answer of his mate given in exact time. I

To-day, May 31st, a red and white cow, being uneasy,
broke out of the steam-mill pasture and crossed
the bridge and broke into Elijah Wood’s grounds. When
he endeavored to drive her out by the bars, she boldly
took to the water, wading first through the meadows
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
full of ditches, and swam across the river, about forty
rods wide at this time, and landed in her own pasture

exploit conferred some dignity on the herd in my eyes,
already dignified, and reflectedly on the river, which I
looked on as a kind of Bosphorus.

I visited a retired, now almost unused, graveyard in
Lincoln to-day, where five British soldiers lie buried
who fell on the 19th April, ’75. Edmund Wheeler,
grandfather of William, who lived in the old house now
pulled down near the present, went over the next day
and carted them to this ground. A few years ago one
Felch, a phrenologist, by leave of the selectmen dug up
and took away two skulls. The skeletons were very
large, probably those of grenadiers. William Wheeler,
who was present, told me this. He said that he had
heard old Mr. Child, who lived opposite, say that when
one soldier was shot he leaped right up his full length
out of the ranks and fell dead; and he, William Wheeler,
saw a bullet-hole through and through one of the skulls.

that these fences, to a considerable extent, will be found
to mark natural divisions, especially if the land is not
very minutely divided,—mowing (upland and meadow)

There will be found in the farmer’s motive for setting a

These artificial divisions no doubt have the effect of
increasing the area and variety to the traveller. These

The year has many seasons more than are recognized
in the almanac. There is that time about the first of
June, the beginning of summer, when the buttercups
blossom in the now luxuriant grass and I am first
reminded of mowing and of the dairy. Every one will
have observed different epochs. There is the time when
they begin to drive cows to pasture,—about the 20th
of May,—observed by the farmer, but a little arbitrary
year by year. Cows spend their winters in barns
and cow-yards, their summers in pastures. In summer,
therefore, they may low with emphasis, “To-morrow to
fresh woods and pastures new.” I sometimes see a
neighbor or two united with their boys and hired men
to drive their cattle to some far-off country pasture, fifty
or sixty miles distant in New Hampshire, early in the
morning, with their sticks and dogs. It is a memorable
time with the farmers’ boys, and frequently their first
journey from home. The herdsman in some mountain
pasture is expecting them. And then in the fall, when
they go up to drive them back, they speculate as to
whether Janet or Brindle will know them. I heard such
a boy exclaim on such an occasion, when the calf of the
spring returned a heifer, as he stroked her side, “She
knows me, father; she knows me.” Driven up to be the
cattle on a thousand hills.
</p>

<p>
I once set fire to the woods. Having set out, one April
day, to go to the sources of Concord River in a boat
with a single companion, meaning to camp on the bank
at night or seek a lodging in some neighboring country
inn or farmhouse, we took fishing tackle with us that we
might fitly procure our food from the stream, Indian-like.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
At the shoemaker’s near the river, we obtained
a match, which we had forgotten. Though it was thus
early in the spring, the river was low, for there had not
been much rain, and we succeeded in catching a mess of
fish sufficient for our dinner before we had left the town,
and by the shores of Fair Haven Pond we proceeded
to cook them. The earth was uncommonly dry, and our
fire, kindled far from the woods in a sunny recess in
the hillside on the east of the pond, suddenly caught
the dry grass of the previous year which grew about the
stump on which it was kindled. We sprang to extinguish
it at first with our hands and feet, and then we fought
it with a board obtained from the boat, but in a few
minutes it was beyond our reach; being on the side of a
hill, it spread rapidly upward, through the long, dry,
wiry grass interspersed with bushes.
</p>

<p>
“Well, where will this end?” asked my companion.
I saw that it might be bounded by Well Meadow Brook
on one side, but would, perchance, go to the village side
of the brook. “It will go to town,” I answered. While
my companion took the boat back down the river, I set
out through the woods to inform the owners and to raise
the town. The fire had already spread a dozen rods on
every side and went leaping and crackling wildly and
irreclaimably toward the wood. That way went the
flames with wild delight, and we felt that we had no
control over the demonic creature to which we had
given birth. We had kindled many fires in the woods
before, burning a clear space in the grass, without ever
kindling such a fire as this.
</p>

<p>
As I ran toward the town through the woods, I could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
see the smoke over the woods behind me marking the
spot and the progress of the flames. The first farmer
whom I met driving a team, after leaving the woods,
inquired the cause of the smoke. I told him. “Well,”
said he, “it is none of my stuff,” and drove along. The
next I met was the owner in his field, with whom I returned
at once to the woods, running all the way. I had
already run two miles. When at length we got into the
neighborhood of the flames, we met a carpenter who
had been hewing timber, an infirm man who had been
driven off by the fire, fleeing with his axe. The farmer
returned to hasten more assistance. I, who was spent
with running, remained. What could I do alone against
a front of flame half a mile wide?
</p>

<p>
I walked slowly through the wood to Fair Haven Cliff,
climbed to the highest rock, and sat down upon it to
observe the progress of the flames, which were rapidly
approaching me, now about a mile distant from the spot
where the fire was kindled. Presently I heard the sound
of the distant bell giving the alarm, and I knew that the
town was on its way to the scene. Hitherto I had felt
like a guilty person,—nothing but shame and regret.
But now I settled the matter with myself shortly. I said
to myself: “Who are these men who are said to be the
owners of these woods, and how am I related to them?
I have set fire to the forest, but I have done no wrong
therein, and now it is as if the lightning had done it.
These flames are but consuming their natural food.”
(It has never troubled me from that day to this more than
if the lightning had done it. The trivial fishing was all
that disturbed me and disturbs me still.) So shortly I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
settled it with myself and stood to watch the approaching
flames.<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> It was a glorious spectacle, and I was the only
one there to enjoy it. The fire now reached the base of
the cliff and then rushed up its sides. The squirrels ran
before it in blind haste, and three pigeons dashed into
the midst of the smoke. The flames flashed up the pines
to their tops, as if they were powder.
</p>

<p>
When I found I was about to be surrounded by the
fire, I retreated and joined the forces now arriving from
the town. It took us several hours to surround the
flames with our hoes and shovels and by back fires subdue
them. In the midst of all I saw the farmer whom
I first met, who had turned indifferently away saying
it was none of his stuff, striving earnestly to save his
corded wood, his stuff, which the fire had already seized
and which it after all consumed.
</p>

<p>
It burned over a hundred acres or more and destroyed
much young wood. When I returned home late in the
day, with others of my townsmen, I could not help
noticing that the crowd who were so ready to condemn
the individual who had kindled the fire did not sympathize
with the owners of the wood, but were in fact
highly elate and as it were thankful for the opportunity
which had afforded them so much sport; and it was only
half a dozen owners, so called, though not all of them,
who looked sour or grieved, and I felt that I had a deeper
interest in the woods, knew them better and should feel
their loss more, than any or all of them. The farmer
whom I had first conducted to the woods was obliged
to ask me the shortest way back, through his own lot.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
Why, then, should the half-dozen owners [and] the individuals
who set the fire alone feel sorrow for the loss of
the wood, while the rest of the town have their spirits
raised? Some of the owners, however, bore their loss
like men, but other some declared behind my back that
I was a “damned rascal;” and a flibbertigibbet or two,
who crowed like the old cock, shouted some reminiscences
of “burnt woods” from safe recesses for some
years after. I have had nothing to say to any of them.
The locomotive engine has since burned over nearly all
the same ground and more, and in some measure blotted
out the memory of the previous fire. For a long time
after I had learned this lesson I marvelled that while
matches and tinder were contemporaries the world was
not consumed; why the houses that have hearths were
not burned before another day; if the flames were not
as hungry now as when I waked them. I at once ceased
to regard the owners and my own fault,—if fault there
was any in the matter,—and attended to the phenomenon
before me, determined to make the most of it. To
be sure, I felt a little ashamed when I reflected on what
a trivial occasion this had happened, that at the time
I was no better employed than my townsmen.
</p>

<p>
That night I watched the fire, where some stumps
still flamed at midnight in the midst of the blackened
waste, wandering through the woods by myself; and
far in the night I threaded my way to the spot where
the fire had taken, and discovered the now broiled fish,—which
had been dressed,—scattered over the burnt
grass.
</p>

<p>
This has been a cool day, though the first of summer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
The prospect of the meadows from Lee’s Hill was very
fine. I observe that the shadows of the trees are very
distinct and heavy in such a day, falling on the fresh
grass. They are as obvious as the trees themselves by
mid-afternoon. Commonly we do not make much
account of the distinct shadows of objects in the landscape.
</p>

<p>
What is bare and unsightly is covered by the water
now. The verdure seems to spring directly from its
bosom; there are no stems nor roots. The meadows are
so many mirrors reflecting the light,—toward sunset
dazzlingly bright.

<p class="p2">
I visited this afternoon (June 3d) Goodman’s Hill in
Sudbury, going through Lincoln over Sherman’s Bridge
and Round Hill, and returning through the Corner. It
probably affords the best view of Concord River meadows
of any hill. The horizon is very extensive as it is,
and if the top were cleared so that you could get the
western view, it would be one of the most extensive seen
from any hill in the county. The most imposing horizons
are those which are seen from tops of hills rising out of
a river valley. The prospect even from a low hill has
something majestic in it in such a case. The landscape
is a vast amphitheatre rising to its rim in the horizon.
There is a good view of Lincoln lying high up in among
the hills. You see that it is the highest town hereabouts,
and hence its fruit. The river at this time looks as large
as the Hudson. I think that a river-valley town is much
the handsomest and largest-featured,—like Concord
and Lancaster, for instance, natural centres. Upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
hills of Bolton, again, the height of land between the
Concord and Nashua, I have seen how the peach
flourishes. Nobscot, too, is quite imposing as seen from
the west side of Goodman’s Hill. On the western side
of a continuation of this hill is Wadsworth’s battle-field.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>
</p>

<p>
Returning, I saw in Sudbury twenty-five nests of the
new (cliff?) swallow under the eaves of a barn. They
seemed particularly social and loquacious neighbors,
though their voices are rather squeaking. Their nests,
built side by side, looked somewhat like large hornets’
nests, enough so to prove a sort of connection. Their
activity, sociability, and chattiness make them fit pensioners
and neighbors of man—summer companions—for
the barn-yard.

The last of May and the first of June the farmers are
everywhere planting their corn and beans and potatoes.

<p class="p2">
To-day, June 4th, I have been tending a burning in
the woods. Ray was there. It is a pleasant fact that you
will know no man long, however low in the social scale,
however poor, miserable, intemperate, and worthless he
may appear to be, a mere burden to society, but you will
find at last that there is something which he understands
and can do better than any other. I was pleased to hear
that one man had sent Ray as the one who had had the
most experience in setting fires of any man in Lincoln.
He had experience and skill as a burner of brush.

<p>
You must burn against the wind always, and burn
slowly. When the fire breaks over the hoed line, a little
system and perseverance will accomplish more toward
quelling it than any man would believe. It fortunately
happens that the experience acquired is oftentimes
worth more than the wages. When a fire breaks out in
the woods, and a man fights it too near and on the side,
in the heat of the moment, without the systematic coöperation
of others, he is disposed to think it a desperate
case, and that this relentless fiend will run through the
forest till it is glutted with food; but let the company
rest from their labors a moment, and then proceed more
deliberately and systematically, giving the fire a wider
berth, and the company will be astonished to find how
soon and easily they will subdue it. The woods themselves
furnish one of the best weapons with which to
contend with the fires that destroy them,—a pitch pine
bough. It is the best instrument to thrash it with. There
are few men who do not love better to give advice than
to give assistance.
</p>

<p>
However large the fire, let a few men go to work
deliberately but perseveringly to rake away the leaves
and hoe off the surface of the ground at a convenient
distance from the fire, while others follow with pine
boughs to thrash it with when it reaches the line, and
they will finally get round it and subdue it, and will be
astonished at their own success.
</p>

<p>
A man who is about to burn his field in the midst
of woods should rake off the leaves and twigs for the
breadth of a rod at least, making no large heaps near the
outside, and then plow around it several furrows and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
break them up with hoes, and set his fire early in the
morning, before the wind rises.
</p>

<p>
As I was fighting the fire to-day, in the midst of the
roaring and crackling,—for the fire seems to snort like
a wild horse,—I heard from time to time the dying
strain, the last sigh, the fine, clear, shrill scream of
agony, as it were, of the trees breathing their last, probably
the heated air or the steam escaping from some
chink. At first I thought it was some bird, or a dying
squirrel’s note of anguish, or steam escaping from the
tree. You sometimes hear it on a small scale in the log
on the hearth. When a field is burned over, the squirrels
probably go into the ground. How foreign is the
yellow pine to the green woods—and what business
has it here?
</p>

<p>
The fire stopped within a few inches of a partridge’s
nest to-day, June 4th, whom we took off in our hands
and found thirteen creamy-colored eggs. I started up a
woodcock when I went to a rill to drink, at the westernmost
angle of R. W. E.’s wood-lot.
</p>

<p>
To-night, June 5th, after a hot day, I hear the first
peculiar summer breathing of the frogs.
</p>

<p>
When all is calm, a small whirlwind will suddenly
lift up the blazing leaves and let them fall beyond
the line, and set all the woods in a blaze in a moment.
Or some slight almost invisible cinder, seed of fire, will
be wafted from the burnt district on to the dry turf
which covers the surface and fills the crevices of many
rocks, and there it will catch as in tinder, and smoke
and smoulder, perchance, for half an hour, heating
several square yards of ground where yet no fire is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
visible, until it spreads to the leaves and the wind fans
it into a blaze.
</p>

<p>
Men go to a fire for entertainment. When I see how
eagerly men will run to a fire, whether in warm or in
cold weather, by day or by night, dragging an engine
at their heels, I am astonished to perceive how good a
purpose the love of excitement is made to serve. What
other force, pray, what offered pay, what disinterested
neighborliness could ever effect so much? No, these
are boys who are to be dealt with, and these are the
motives that prevail. There is no old man or woman
dropping into the grave but covets excitement.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, when I walked to Goodman’s Hill, it
seemed to me that the atmosphere was never so full of
fragrance and spicy odors. There is a great variety in
the fragrance of the apple blossoms as well as their tints.
Some are quite spicy. The air seemed filled with the
odor of ripe strawberries, though it is quite too early for
them. The earth was not only fragrant but sweet and
spicy to the smell, reminding us of Arabian gales and
what mariners tell of the spice islands. The first of
June, when the lady’s-slipper and the wild pink have
come out in sunny places on the hillsides, then the
summer is begun according to the clock of the seasons.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Here it is the 8th of June, and the grass is growing
apace. In the front yards of the village they are already
beginning to cut it. The fields look luxuriant and verdurous,
but, as the weather is warmer, the atmosphere
is not so clear. In distant woods the partridge sits on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
her eggs, and at evening the frogs begin to dream and
boys begin to bathe in the river and ponds.

town clocks and family clocks are already half dispensed

will keep time and order for a whole country. The
startings and arrivals of the cars are the epochs in a

Not till June can the grass be said to be waving in

to bathe in the ponds and streams, then is summer
begun.

June 9th, 1850, Walden is still rising, though the
rains have ceased and the river has fallen very much.
I see the pollen of the pitch pine now beginning to cover

end have none, and on some there is only
one pollen-bearing flower.

I saw a striped snake which the fire in the woods had

with its body partly coiled up and raised from the ground,

and its head still erect as if ready to dart out its tongue

After this and some other fires in the woods which I
helped to put out, a more effectual system by which to
quell them occurred to me. When the bell rings, hundreds
will run to a fire in the woods without carrying
any implement, and then waste much time after they
get there either in doing nothing or what is worse than
nothing, having come mainly out of curiosity, it being
as interesting to see it burn as to put it out. I thought
that it would be well if forty or fifty men in every
country town should enroll themselves into a company
for this purpose and elect suitable officers. The town
should provide a sufficient number of rakes, hoes, and
shovels, which it should be the duty of certain of the company
to convey to [the] woods in a wagon, together with
the drum, on the first alarm, people being unwilling to
carry their own tools for fear they will be lost. When
the captain or one of the numerous vice-captains arrives,
having inspected the fire and taken his measures,
let him cause the roll to be called, however the men may
be engaged, and just take a turn or two with his men to
form them into sections and see where they are. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
he can appoint and equip his rake-men and his hoe-men
and his bough-men, and drop them at the proper
places, always retaining the drummer and a scout; and
when he has learned through his scout that the fire has
broken out in a new place, he, by beat of drum, can
take up one or two men of each class—as many as
can be spared—and repair to the scene of danger.
</p>

<p>
One of my friends suggests instead of the drum some
delicious music, adding that then he would come. It
might be well, to refresh the men when wearied with
work, and cheer them on their return. Music is the
proper regulator.

So, far in the East, among the Yezidis, or Worshippers
of the Devil, so called, and the Chaldæans, and so
forth, you may hear these remarkable disputations on
doctrinal points.<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Any reverence, even for a material thing, proceeds
from an elevation of character. Layard, speaking of the
reverence for the sun exhibited by the Yezidis, or Worshippers
of the Devil, says: “They are accustomed to
kiss the object on which its first beams fall; and I
have frequently, when travelling in their company at sunrise,
observed them perform this ceremony. For fire,
as symbolic, they have nearly the same reverence; they
never spit into it, but frequently pass their hands through
the flame, kiss them, and rub them over their right eyebrow,
or sometimes over the whole face.”

I observe to-night, June 15th, the air over the river
by the Leaning Hemlocks filled with myriads of newly
fledged insects drifting and falling as it were like snowflakes
from the maples, only not so white. Now they
drift up the stream, now down, while the river below is
dimpled with the fishes rising to swallow the innumerable
insects which have fallen [into] it and are struggling
with it. I saw how He fed his fish. They, swimming in
the dark nether atmosphere of the river, rose lazily to
its surface to swallow such swimmers of the light upper

<i>June 20.</i> I can see from my window three or four
cows in a pasture on the side of Fair Haven Hill, a mile
and a half distant. There is but one tree in the pasture,
and they are all collected and now reposing in its shade,
which, as it is early though sultry, is extended a good
way along the ground. It makes a pretty landscape.
That must have been an epoch in the history of the cow
when they discovered to stand in the shadow of a tree.
I wonder if they are wise enough to recline on the north
side of it, that they may not be disturbed so soon. It
shows the importance of leaving trees for shade in the
pastures as well as for beauty. There is a long black
streak, and in it the cows are collected. How much
more they will need this shelter at noon! It is a pleasant
life they lead in the summer,—roaming in well-watered
pastures, grazing, and chewing the cud in the shade,—quite
a philosophic life and favorable for contemplation,
not like their pent-up winter life in close and foul
barns. If only they could say as on the prairies, “To-morrow
to fresh woods and pastures new.”

Cattle and horses, however, retain many of their wild
habits or instincts wonderfully. The seeds of instinct
are preserved under their thick hides, like seeds in the
bowels of the earth, an indefinite period.<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> I have heard
of a horse which his master could not catch in his
pasture when the first snowflakes were falling, who persisted
in wintering out. As he persisted in keeping out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
of his reach, his master finally left him. When the snow
had covered the ground three or four inches deep, the
horse pawed it away to come at the grass,—just as the
wild horses of Michigan do, who are turned loose by their
Indian masters,—and so he picked up a scanty subsistence.
By the next day he had had enough of free life and
pined for his stable, and so suffered himself to be caught.

A blacksmith, my neighbor, heard a great clattering
noise the other day behind his shop, and on going out
found that his mare and his neighbor the pumpmaker’s
were fighting. They would run at one another, then
turn round suddenly and let their heels fly. The rattling
of their hoofs one against the other was the noise
he heard. They repeated this several times with intervals
of grazing, until one prevailed. The next day they
bore the marks of some bruises, some places where the
skin was rucked up, and some swellings.

And then for my afternoon walks I have a garden,
larger than any artificial garden that I have read of
and far more attractive to me,—mile after mile of
embowered walks, such as no nobleman’s grounds can
boast, with animals running free and wild therein as
from the first,—varied with land and water prospect,
and, above all, so retired that it is extremely rare that I
meet a single wanderer in its mazes. No gardener is
seen therein, no gates nor [<i>sic</i>]. You may wander away
to solitary bowers and brooks and hills.

But these are only the disadvantages of a fire. It is
without doubt an advantage on the whole. It sweeps
and ventilates the forest floor, and makes it clear and
clean. It is nature’s besom. By destroying the punier
underwood it gives prominence to the larger and sturdier
trees, and makes a wood in which you can go and come.
I have often remarked with how much more comfort
and pleasure I could walk in woods through which a fire
had run the previous year. It will clean the forest floor
like a broom perfectly smooth and clear,—no twigs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>

When the lightning burns the forest its Director makes

through the charred surface with more vigorous growth.

Sometimes an arrowhead is found with the mouldering

It is astonishing how much information is to be got
out of very unpromising witnesses. A wise man will
avail himself of the observation of all. Every boy and

inquire of eyes what they have seen, of ears what they

Many men walk by day; few walk by night. It is a
very different season. Instead of the sun, there are
the moon and stars; instead of the wood thrush, there
is the whip-poor-will; instead of butterflies, fireflies,
winged sparks of fire! who would have believed it?
What kind of life and cool deliberation dwells in a spark
of fire in dewy abodes? Every man carries fire in his
eye, or in his blood, or in his brain. Instead of singing
birds, the croaking of frogs and the intenser dream
of crickets. The potatoes stand up straight, the corn
grows, the bushes loom, and, in a moonlight night, the
shadows of rocks and trees and bushes and hills are more
conspicuous than the objects themselves. The slightest
inequalities in the ground are revealed by the shadows;
what the feet find comparatively smooth appears rough
and diversified to the eye. The smallest recesses in the
rocks are dim and cavernous; the ferns in the wood
appear to be of tropical size; the pools seen through the
leaves become as full of light as the sky. “The light of
day takes refuge in their bosom,” as the Purana says of
the ocean. The woods are heavy and dark. Nature
slumbers. The rocks retain the warmth of the sun which
they have absorbed all night.<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a>

destiny; stepping after her race; who had stayed to tuck
them up in their long sleep. For whom berries condescend
to grow. I have not seen one on the Musketaquid
for many a year, and some who came up in their canoes
and camped on its banks a dozen years ago had to ask
me where it came from. A lone Indian woman without
children, accompanied by her dog, wearing the shroud
of her race, performing the last offices for her departed
race. Not yet absorbed into the elements again; a

I find the actual to be far less real to me than the
imagined. Why this singular prominence and importance
is given to the former, I do not know. In proportion
as that which possesses my thoughts is removed
from the actual, it impresses me. I have never met with
anything so truly visionary and accidental as some
actual events. They have affected me less than my
dreams. Whatever actually happens to a man is wonderfully
trivial and insignificant,—even to death itself, I
imagine. He complains of the fates who drown him,
that they do not touch <i>him</i>. They do not deal directly
with him. I have in my pocket a button which I ripped
off the coat of the Marquis of Ossoli<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> on the seashore
the other day. Held up, it intercepts the light and casts
a shadow,—an <i>actual</i> button so called,—and yet all
the life it is connected with is less substantial to me than
my faintest dreams. This stream of events which we
consent to call actual, and that other mightier stream
which alone carries us with it,—what makes the difference?
On the one our bodies float, and we have sympathy
with it through them; on the other, our spirits.
We are ever dying to one world and being born into
another, and possibly no man knows whether he is at
any time dead in the sense in which he affirms that
phenomenon of another, or not. Our thoughts are the
epochs of our life: all else is but as a journal of the
winds that blew while we were here.<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[32]</a>

Do a little more of that work which you have sometime
confessed to be good, which you feel that society and
your justest judge rightly demands of you. Do what you
reprove yourself for not doing. Know that you are
neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with yourself without
reason. Let me say to you and to myself in one breath,
Cultivate the tree which you have found to bear fruit in
your soil. Regard not your past failures nor successes.
All the past is equally a failure and a success; it is a
success in as much as it offers you the present opportunity.
Have you not a pretty good thinking faculty, worth
more than the rarest gold watch? Can you not pass a

Die, if you can. Depart. Exchange your salvation for
a glass of water. If you know of any risk to run, run it.
If you don’t know of any, enjoy confidence. Do not
trouble yourself to be religious; you will never get a
thank-you for it. If you can drive a nail and have any
nails to drive, drive them. If you have any experiments
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
you would like to try, try them; now’s your chance. Do
not entertain doubts, if they are not agreeable to you.
Send them to the tavern. Do not eat unless you are
hungry; there’s no need of it. Do not read the newspapers.
Improve every opportunity to be melancholy.
Be as melancholy as you can be, and note the result.
Rejoice with fate. As for health, consider yourself well,
and mind your business. Who knows but you are dead
already? Do not stop to be scared yet; there are more
terrible things to come, and ever to come. Men die of
fright and live of confidence. Be not simply obedient
like the vegetables; set up your own Ebenezer. Of
man’s “<i>dis</i>obedience and the fruit,” etc. Do not engage
to find things as you think they are. Do what nobody

common for wells near the shore to rise and fall with the
tide. It is an interesting fact that the low sand-bars in
the midst of the ocean, even those which are laid bare
only at low tide, are reservoirs of fresh water at which
the thirsty mariner can supply himself. Perchance, like
huge sponges, they hold the rain and dew which falls on
them, and which, by capillary attraction, is prevented
from mingling with the surrounding brine.<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a>

Getting into Patchogue late one night in an oyster-boat,
there was a drunken Dutchman aboard whose
wit reminded me of Shakespeare. When we came to
leave the beach, our boat was aground, and we were
detained three hours waiting for the tide. In the meanwhile
two of the fishermen took an extra dram at the
beach house. Then they stretched themselves on the
seaweed by the shore in the sun to sleep off the effects
of their debauch. One was an inconceivably broad-faced
young Dutchman,—but oh! of such a peculiar
breadth and heavy look, I should not know whether
to call it more ridiculous or sublime. You would say
that he had humbled himself so much that he was
beginning to be exalted. An indescribable mynheerish
stupidity. I was less disgusted by their filthiness and
vulgarity, because I was compelled to look on them as
animals, as swine in their sty. For the whole voyage
they lay flat on their backs on the bottom of the boat,
in the bilge-water and wet with each bailing, half insensible
and wallowing in their vomit. But ever and
anon, when aroused by the rude kicks or curses of the
skipper, the Dutchman, who never lost his wit nor
equanimity, though snoring and rolling in the vomit
produced by his debauch, blurted forth some happy
repartee like an illuminated swine. It was the earthiest,
slimiest wit I ever heard. The countenance was one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
a million. It was unmistakable Dutch. In the midst
of a million faces of other races it could not be mistaken.
It told of Amsterdam. I kept racking my brains to
conceive how he could have been born in America, how
lonely he must feel, what he did for fellowship. When
we were groping up the narrow creek of Patchogue at
ten o’clock at night, keeping our boat off, now from
this bank, now from that, with a pole, the two inebriates
roused themselves betimes. For in spite of their low
estate they seemed to have all their wits as much about
them as ever, aye, and all the self-respect they ever had.
And the Dutchman gave wise directions to the steerer,
which were not heeded. Suddenly rousing himself up
where the sharpest-eyed might be bewildered in the
darkness, he leaned over the side of the boat and pointed
straight down into the creek, averring that that identical
hole was a first-rate place for eels. And again he
roused himself at the right time and declared what
luck he had once had with his pots (not his cups) in
another place, which we were floating over in the dark.
At last he suddenly stepped on to another boat which
was moored to the shore, with a divine ease and sureness,
saying, “Well, good-night, take care of yourselves,
I can’t be with you any longer.” He was one of the few
remarkable men whom I have met. I have been impressed
by one or two men in their cups. There was
really a divinity stirred within them, so that in their
case I have reverenced the drunken, as savages the insane,
man. So stupid that he could never be intoxicated.
When I said, “You have had a hard time of it to-day,”
he answered with indescribable good humor out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
very midst of his debauch, with watery eyes, “Well, it
doesn’t happen every day.” It was happening then.<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a>
He had taken me aboard on his back, the boat lying a
rod from the shore, before I knew his condition. In the
darkness our skipper steered with a pole on the bottom,
for an oysterman knows the bottom of his bay as well
as the shores, and can tell where he is by the soundings.<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[45]</a>

There was a glorious lurid sunset to-night, accompanied
with many sombre clouds, and when I looked
into the west with my head turned, the grass had the
same fresh green, and the distant herbage and foliage
in the horizon the same bark blue, and the clouds and
sky the same bright colors beautifully mingled and dissolving
into one another, that I have seen in pictures of
tropical landscapes and skies. Pale saffron skies with
faint fishes of rosy clouds dissolving in them. A blood-stained
sky. I regretted that I had an impatient companion.
What shall we make of the fact that you have
only to stand on your head a moment to be enchanted
with the beauty of the landscape?

I met with a man on the beach who told me that
when he wanted to jump over a brook he held up one
leg a certain height, and then, if a line from his eye
through his toe touched the opposite bank, he knew
that he could jump it. I asked him how he knew when
he held his leg at the right angle, and he said he knew
the hitch very well. An Irishman told me that he held
up one leg and if he could bring his toe in a range with
his eye and the opposite bank he knew that he could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
jump it. Why, I told him, I can blot out a star with my
toe, but I would not engage to jump the distance. It
then appeared that he knew when he had got his leg at
the right height by a certain hitch there was in it. I
suggested that he should connect his two ankles with a
string.<a name='FA_46' id='FA_46' href='#FN_46' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a>

I can easily walk ten, fifteen, twenty, any number of
miles, commencing at my own door, without going by
any house, without crossing a road except where the fox
and the mink do. Concord is the oldest inland town
in New England, perhaps in the States, and the walker
is peculiarly favored here. There are square miles in
my vicinity which have no inhabitant. First along by
the river, and then the brook, and then the meadow and
the woodside. Such solitude! From a hundred hills
I can see civilization and abodes of man afar. These
farmers and their works are scarcely more obvious than
woodchucks.<a name='FA_47' id='FA_47' href='#FN_47' class='fnanchor'>[47]</a>

That is a peculiar season when about the middle of
August the farmers are getting their meadow-hay. If
you sail up the river, you will see them in all meadows,
raking hay and loading it on to carts, great towering [?]
teams, under which the oxen stand like beetles, chewing
the cud, waiting for men to put the meadow on. With
the heaviest load they dash aside to crop some more
savory grass,—the half-broken steers.

There was reason enough for the first settler’s selecting
the elm out of all the trees of the forest with which
to ornament his villages. It is beautiful alike by sunlight
and moonlight, and the most beautiful specimens
are not the largest. I have seen some only twenty-five
or thirty years old, more graceful and healthy, I think,
than any others. It is almost become a villageous tree,—like
martins and bluebirds.

<p>Among the signs of autumn I perceive</p>
<p>The Roman wormwood (called by learned men</p>
<p><i>Ambrosia elatior</i>, food for gods,</p>
<p>For by impartial science the humblest weed</p>
<p>Is as well named as is the proudest flower)</p>
<p>Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoes</p>
<p>As I brush through the now neglected garden.</p>
<p>We trample under foot the food of gods</p>
<p>And spill their nectar in each drop of dew.</p>
<p>My honest shoes, fast friends that never stray</p>
<p>Far from my couch, thus powdered, countrified,</p>
<p>Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure,</p>
<p>At the post-house disgrace the Gallic gloss</p>
<p>Of those well-dressed ones who no morning dew</p>
<p>Nor Roman wormwood ever have gone through,</p>

The gray blueberry bushes, venerable as oaks,—why
is not their fruit poisonous? Bilberry called <i>Vaccinium
corymbosum</i>; some say <i>amœnum</i>, or blue bilberry,
and <i>Vaccinium disomorphum</i> Mx., black bilberry.
Its fruit hangs on into September, but loses its
wild and sprightly taste.

The purple flowers of the humble trichostema mingled
with the wormwood, smelling like it; and the spring-scented,
dandelion-scented primrose, yellow primrose.
The swamp-pink (<i>Azalea viscosa</i>), its now withered pistils
standing out.

<p>
The odoriferous sassafras, with its delicate green
stem, its three-lobed leaf, tempting the traveller to
bruise it, it sheds so rare a perfume on him, equal to all
the spices of the East. Then its rare-tasting root bark,
like nothing else, which I used to dig. The first navigators
freighted their ships with it and deemed it worth
its weight in gold.

The alder-leaved clethra (<i>Clethra alnifolia</i>), sweet-smelling
queen of the swamp; its long white racemes.

which appear earliest in the spring. I look with equal
affection on those which are the latest to bloom in the fall.

The beautiful white waxen berries of the cornel, either
<i>Cornus alba</i> or <i>paniculata</i>, white-berried or panicled,

spreading its little fairy fingers to the skies, its little
palms; fairy palms they might be called.

they are railroads or trackless through the wilds, but
what the powers permit each one enjoys. My solitary

is of much more importance—from Heaven, to

course I do,—to take the necessary lands and pay the
damages. It is by the grace of God in both cases.

Now, about the first of September, you will see flocks

In the twilight, when you can only see the outlines of
the trees in the horizon, the elm-tops indicate where the
houses are. I have looked afar over fields and even over
distant woods and distinguished the conspicuous graceful,
sheaf-like head of an elm which shadowed some
farmhouse. From the northwest (?) part of Sudbury
you can see an elm on the Boston road, on the hilltop in
the horizon in Wayland, five or six miles distant. The
elm is a tree which can be distinguished farther off perhaps
than any other. The wheelwright still makes his
hubs of it, his spokes of white oak, his fellies of yellow
oak, which does not crack on the corners. In England,
’tis said, they use the ash for fellies.

There is a little grove in a swampy place in Conantum

Though the potatoes have man with all his implements

Charles<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55' href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[55]</a> grew up to be a remarkably eccentric man.
He was of large frame, athletic, and celebrated for his
feats of strength. His lungs were proportionally strong.
There was a man who heard him named once, and
asked if it was the same Charles Dunbar whom he
remembered when he was a little boy walking on the
coast of Maine. A man came down to the shore and
hailed a vessel that was sailing by. He should never
forget that man’s name.

<p>I saw a delicate flower had grown up two feet high</p>
<p>Between the horses’ path and the wheel-track,</p>
<p>Which Dakin’s and Maynard’s wagons had</p>
<p>Passed over many a time.</p>
<p>An inch more to right or left had sealed its fate,</p>
<p>Or an inch higher. And yet it lived and flourished</p>
<p>As much as if it had a thousand acres</p>
<p>Of untrodden space around it, and never</p>
<p>Knew the danger it incurred.</p>
<p>It did not borrow trouble nor invite an</p>

<p>For though the distant market-wagon</p>
<p>Every other day inevitably rolled</p>
<p>This way, it just as inevitably rolled</p>
<p>In those ruts. And the same</p>
<p>Charioteer who steered the flower</p>
<p>Upward guided the horse and cart aside from it.</p>
<p>There were other flowers which you would say</p>
<p>Incurred less danger, grew more out of the way,</p>
<p>Which no cart rattled near, no walker daily passed,</p>
<p>But at length one rambling deviously—</p>
<p>For no rut restrained—plucked them,</p>
<p>And then it appeared that they stood</p>
<p>Directly in his way, though he had come</p>
<p>From farther than the market-wagon.</p>

<p>
And then it appeared that this brave flower which
grew between the wheel and horse did actually stand
farther out of the way than that which stood in the wide
prairie where the man of science plucked it.

<p>To-day I climbed a handsome rounded hill</p>
<p>Covered with hickory trees, wishing to see</p>
<p>The country from its top, for low hills</p>
<p>Show unexpected prospects. I looked</p>
<p>Many miles over a woody lowland</p>
<p>Toward Marlborough, Framingham, and Sudbury;</p>
<p>And as I sat amid the hickory trees</p>


<p>
And the young sumachs, enjoying the prospect, a
neat herd of cows approached, of unusually fair proportions
and smooth, clean skins, evidently petted by
their owner, who must have carefully selected them.
One more confiding heifer, the fairest of the herd, did
by degrees approach as if to take some morsel from
our hands, while our hearts leaped to our mouths with
expectation and delight. She by degrees drew near
with her fair limbs progressive, making pretense of
browsing; nearer and nearer, till there was wafted
toward us the bovine fragrance,—cream of all the
dairies that ever were or will be,—and then she raised
her gentle muzzle toward us, and snuffed an honest
recognition within hand’s reach. I saw ’t was possible
for his herd to inspire with love the herdsman. She
was as delicately featured as a hind. Her hide was
mingled white and fawn-color, and on her muzzle’s
tip there was a white spot not bigger than a daisy, and
on her side toward me the map of Asia plain to see.
</p>

<p>
Farewell, dear heifer! Though thou forgettest me,
my prayer to heaven shall be that thou may’st not forget
thyself. There was a whole bucolic in her snuff.
I saw her name was Sumach. And by the kindred
spots I knew her mother, more sedate and matronly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
with full-grown bag; and on her sides was Asia, great
and small, the plains of Tartary, even to the pole,
while on her daughter it was Asia Minor. She not disposed
to wanton with the herdsman.
</p>

<p>
And as I walked, she followed me, and took an apple
from my hand, and seemed to care more for the
hand than apple. So innocent a face as I have rarely
seen on any creature, and I have looked in face of many
heifers. And as she took the apple from my hand, I
caught the apple of her eye. She smelled as sweet as
the clethra blossom. There was no sinister expression.
And for horns, though she had them, they were so well
disposed in the right place, bent neither up nor down,
I do not now remember she had any. No horn was held
toward me.<a name='FA_57' id='FA_57' href='#FN_57' class='fnanchor'>[57]</a>

I am glad to have drunk water so long, as I prefer the
natural sky to an opium-eater’s heaven,—would keep
sober always, and lead a sane life not indebted to stimulants.
Whatever my practice may be, I believe that it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
is the only drink for a wise man, and only the foolish
habitually use any other. Think of dashing the hopes
of a morning with a cup of coffee, or of an evening with
a dish of tea! Wine is not a noble liquor, except when
it is confined to the pores of the grape. Even music is
wont to be intoxicating. Such apparently slight causes

I have seen where the rain dripped from the trees on
a sand-bank on the Marlborough road, that each little
pebble which had protected the sand made the summit

The trees on the bank of the river have white furrows

Water is so much more fine and sensitive an element
than earth. A single boatman passing up or down
unavoidably shakes the whole of a wide river, and disturbs
its every reflection. The air is an element which
our voices shake still further than our oars the water.
</p>

<p>
The red maples on the river, standing far in the water
when the banks are overflown and touched by the
earliest frosts, are memorable features in the scenery of
the stream at this season.
</p>

<p>
Now you can scent the ripe grapes far off on the banks
as you row along. Their fragrance is finer than their
flavor.
</p>

<p>
My companion said he would drink when the boat got
under the bridge, because the water would be cooler in
the shade, though the stream quickly passes through the
piers from shade to sun again. It is something beautiful,
the act of drinking, the stooping to imbibe some of
this widespread element, in obedience to instinct, without
whim. We do not so simply drink in other influences.

A family in which there was singing in the morning.
To hear a neighbor singing! All other speech sounds
thereafter like profanity. A man cannot sing falsehood
or cowardice; he must sing truth and heroism to attune
his voice to some instrument. It would be noblest to
sing with the wind. I have seen a man making himself
a viol, patiently and fondly paring the thin wood and
shaping it, and when I considered the end of the work
he was ennobled in my eyes. He was building himself a
ship in which to sail to new worlds. I am much indebted
to my neighbor who will now and then in the intervals
of his work draw forth a few strains from his accordion.
Though he is but a learner, I find when his strains cease
that I have been elevated.

However mean your life is, meet it and live; do not

are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The faultfinder

poor as it is. You may perchance have some pleasant,
thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting
sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse
as brightly as from the rich man’s house. The snow
melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not
see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and
have as cheering thoughts as anywhere, and, indeed, the
town’s poor seem to live the most independent lives of
any. They are simply great enough to receive without
misgiving. Cultivate poverty like sage, like a garden
herb. Do not trouble yourself to get new things, whether
clothes or friends. That is dissipation. Turn the old;
return to them. Things do not change; we change. If

That the brilliant leaves of autumn are not withered
ones is proved by the fact that they wilt when gathered
as soon as the green.
</p>

<p>
But now, October 31st, they are all withered. This
has been the most perfect afternoon in the year. The
air quite warm enough, perfectly still and dry and clear,
and not a cloud in the sky. Scarcely the song of a cricket
is heard to disturb the stillness. When they ceased their
song I do not know. I wonder that the impetus which
our hearing had got did not hurry us into deafness over
a precipitous silence. There must have been a thick web
of cobwebs on the grass this morning, promising this
fair day, for I see them still through the afternoon,
covering not only the grass but the bushes and the trees.
They are stretched across the unfrequented roads from
weed to weed, and broken by the legs of the horses.
</p>

<p>
I thought to-day that it would be pleasing to study
the dead and withered plants, the ghosts of plants,
which now remain in the fields, for they fill almost as
large a space to the eye as the green have done. They

As we were passing through Ashburnham, by a new
white house which stood at some distance in a field, one
passenger exclaimed so that all the passengers could
hear him, “There, there’s not so good a house as that
in all Canada.” And I did not much wonder at his
remark. There is a neatness as well as thrift and elastic
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
comfort, a certain flexible easiness of circumstance when
not rich, about a New England house which the Canadian
houses do not suggest. Though of stone, they were
no better constructed than a stone barn would be with
us. The only building on which money and taste are
expended is the church.<a name='FA_65' id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[65]</a> At Beauport we examined

Looking through a stately pine grove, I saw the
western sun falling in golden streams through its aisles.
Its west side, opposite to me, was all lit up with golden
light; but what was I to it? Such sights remind me of
houses which we never inhabit,—that commonly I am
not at home in the world. I see somewhat fairer than
I enjoy or possess.
</p>

<p>
A fair afternoon, a celestial afternoon, cannot occur
but we mar our pleasure by reproaching ourselves that
we do not make all our days beautiful. The thought of
what I am, of my pitiful conduct, deters me from receiving
what joy I might from the glorious days that visit me.

I see it to advantage now and without incumbrance; I
have not yet imported my humdrum thoughts, my prosaic
habits, into it to mar the landscape. What is this
beauty in the landscape but a certain fertility in me? I
look in vain to see it realized but in my own life. If
I could wholly cease to be ashamed of myself, I think

The oystermen had anchored their boat near the shore
without regard to the state of the tide, and when we
came to it to set sail, just after noon, we found that
it was aground. Seeing that they were preparing to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
push it off, I was about to take off my shoes and stockings
in order to wade to it first, but a Dutch sailor with
a singular bullfrog or trilobite expression of the eyes,
whose eyes were like frog ponds in the broad platter
of his cheeks and gleamed like a pool covered with
frog-spittle, immediately offered me the use of his back.
So mounting, with my legs under his arms, and hugging
him like one of [the] family, he set me aboard of
the periauger?
</p>

<p>
They then leaned their hardest against the stern,
bracing their feet against the sandy bottom in two feet
of water, the Dutchman with his broad back among
them. In the most Dutch-like and easy way they
applied themselves to this labor, while the skipper
tried to raise the bows, never jerking or hustling but
silently exerting what vigor was inherent in them, doing,
no doubt, their utmost endeavor, while I pushed with a
spike pole; but it was all in vain. It was decided to be
unsuccessful; we did not disturb its bed by a grain of
sand. “Well, what now?” said I. “How long have we
got to wait?” “Till the tide rises,” said the captain.
But no man knew of the tide, how it was. So I went in
to bathe, looking out for sharks and chasing crabs, and
the Dutchman waded out among the mussels to spear
a crab. The skipper stuck a clamshell into the sand
at the water’s edge to discover if it was rising, and
the sailors,—the Dutchman and the other,—having
got more drink at Oakes’s, stretched themselves on the
seaweed close to the water’s edge [and] went to sleep.
After an hour or more we could discover no change in
the shell even by a hair’s breadth, from which we learned

I once went in search of the relics of a human body—a
week after a wreck—which had been cast up the
day before on to the beach, though the sharks had
stripped off the flesh. I got the direction from a lighthouse.
I should find it a mile or two distant over the
sand, a dozen rods from the water, by a stick which was
stuck up covered with a cloth. Pursuing the direction
pointed out, I expected that I should have to look very
narrowly at the sand to find so small an object, but
so completely smooth and bare was the beach—half
a mile wide of sand—and so magnifying the mirage
toward the sea that when I was half a mile distant the insignificant
stick or sliver which marked the spot looked
like a broken mast in the sand. As if there was no other
object, this trifling sliver had puffed itself up to the vision
to fill the void; and there lay the relics in a certain
state, rendered perfectly inoffensive to both bodily and
spiritual eye by the surrounding scenery,—a slight inequality
in the sweep of the shore. Alone with the sea
and the beach, attending to the sea, whose hollow roar
seemed addressed to the ears of the departed,—articulate

There is a good echo from that wood to one standing
on the side of Fair Haven. It was particularly good
to-day. The woodland lungs seemed particularly
sound to-day; they echoed your shout with a fuller and
rounder voice than it was given in, seeming to <i>mouth</i>
it. It was uttered with a sort of sweeping intonation
half round a vast circle, <i>ore rotundo</i>, by a broad dell
among the tree-tops passing it round to the entrance of
all the aisles of the wood. You had to choose the right
key or pitch, else the woods would not echo it with
any spirit, and so with eloquence. Of what significance
is any sound if Nature does not echo it? It does not
prevail. It dies away as soon as uttered. I wonder that
wild men have not made more of echoes, or that we do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
not hear that they have made more. It would be a
pleasant, a soothing and cheerful mission to go about
the country in search of them,—articulating, speaking,
vocal, oracular, resounding, sonorous, hollow, prophetic
places; places wherein to found an oracle, sites
for oracles, sacred ears of Nature.

I used to strike with a paddle on the side of my boat

There was a sawmill once on Nut Meadow Brook,
near Jennie’s Road. These little brooks have their
history. They once turned sawmills. They even used
their <i>influence</i> to destroy the primitive [forests] which
grew on their banks, and now, for their reward, the sun
is let in to dry them up and narrow their channels.
Their crime rebounds against themselves. You still
find the traces of ancient dams where the simple brooks
were taught to use their influence to destroy the primitive
forests on their borders, and now for penalty they
flow in shrunken channels, with repentant and plaintive
tinkling through the wood, being by an evil spirit turned
against their neighbor forests.

I was one evening passing a retired farmhouse which
had a smooth green plat before it, just after sundown,
when I saw a hen turkey which had gone to roost on the
front fence with her wings outspread over her young
now pretty well advanced, who were roosting on the
next rail a foot or two below her. It completed a picture
of rural repose and happiness such as I had not seen
for a long time. A particularly neat and quiet place,
where the very ground was swept around the wood-pile.

him as a matter of course; just as the lawyer weaves

<i>Nov. 8.</i> The stillness of the woods and fields is remarkable
at this season of the year. There is not even
the creak of a cricket to be heard. Of myriads of dry
shrub oak leaves, not one rustles. Your own breath
can rustle them, yet the breath of heaven does not
suffice to. The trees have the aspect of waiting for winter.
The autumnal leaves have lost their color; they
are now truly sere, dead, and the woods wear a sombre
color. Summer and harvest are over. The hickories,
birches, chestnuts, no less than the maples, have lost
their leaves. The sprouts, which had shot up so vigorously
to repair the damage which the choppers had done,
have stopped short for the winter. Everything stands
silent and expectant. If I listen, I hear only the note
of a chickadee,—our most common and I may say
native bird, most identified with our forests,—or perchance
the scream of a jay, or perchance from the
solemn depths of these woods I hear tolling far away
the knell of one departed. Thought rushes in to fill the
vacuum. As you walk, however, the partridge still bursts
away. The silent, dry, almost leafless, certainly fruitless
woods. You wonder what cheer that bird can find
in them. The partridge bursts away from the foot of
a shrub oak like its own dry fruit, immortal bird! This
sound still startles us. Dry goldenrods, now turned
gray and white, lint our clothes as we walk. And the
drooping, downy seed-vessels of the epilobium remind
us of the summer. Perchance you will meet with a few
solitary asters in the dry fields, with a little color left.
The sumach is stripped of everything but its cone of red
berries.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This is a peculiar season, peculiar for its stillness.
The crickets have ceased their song. The few birds
are well-nigh silent. The tinted and gay leaves are now
sere and dead, and the woods wear a sombre aspect.
A carpet of snow under the pines and shrub oaks will
make it look more cheerful. Very few plants have now
their spring. But thoughts still spring in man’s brain.
There are no flowers nor berries to speak of. The
grass begins to die at top. In the morning it is stiff with
frost. Ice has been discovered in somebody’s tub very
early this morn, of the thickness of a dollar. The flies
are betwixt life and death. The wasps come into the
houses and settle on the walls and windows. All insects
go into crevices. The fly is entangled in a web and
struggles vainly to escape, but there is no spider to secure
him; the corner of the pane is a deserted camp. When
I lived in the woods the wasps came by thousands to my
lodge in November, as to winter quarters, and settled
on my windows and on the walls over my head, sometimes
deterring visitors from entering. Each morning,
when they were numbed with cold, I swept some of
them out. But I did not trouble myself to get rid of them.
They never molested me, though they bedded with me,
and they gradually disappeared into what crevices I do
not know, avoiding winter.<a name='FA_72' id='FA_72' href='#FN_72' class='fnanchor'>[72]</a> I saw a squash-bug go
slowly behind a clapboard to avoid winter. As some of
these melon seeds come up in the garden again in the
spring, so some of these squash-bugs come forth. The
flies are for a long time in a somnambulic state. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
have too little energy or <i>vis vitæ</i> to clean their wings or
heads, which are covered with dust. They buzz and
bump their heads against the windows two or three
times a day, or lie on their backs in a trance, and that is
all,—two or three short spurts. One of these mornings
we shall hear that Mr. Minott had to break the ice to
water his cow. And so it will go on till the ground
freezes. If the race had never lived through a winter,
what would they think was coming?

Walden Pond has at last fallen a little. It has been
so high over the stones—quite into the bushes—that
walkers have been excluded from it.<a name='FA_73' id='FA_73' href='#FN_73' class='fnanchor'>[73]</a> There has been
no accessible shore. All ponds have been high. The
water stood higher than usual in the distant ponds
which I visited and had never seen before. It has been
a peculiar season. At Goose Pond, I notice that the
birches of one year’s growth from the stumps standing
in the water are all dead, apparently killed by the
water, unless, like the pine, they die down after springing
from the stump.
</p>

<p>
It is warm somewhere any day in the year. You will
find some nook in the woods generally, at mid-forenoon
of the most blustering day, where you may forget the
cold. I used to resort to the northeast side of Walden,
where the sun, reflected from the pine woods on the
stony shore, made it the fireside of the pond. It is so
much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the
sun when you can, than by a fire.
</p>

<p>
I saw to-day a double reflection on the pond of the

<i>Nov. 9.</i> It is a pleasant surprise to walk over a hill
where an old wood has recently been cut off, and, on
looking round, to see, instead of dense ranks of trees
almost impermeable to light, distant well-known blue
mountains in the horizon and perchance a white village
over an expanded open country. I now take this in
preference to all my old familiar walks. So a new prospect
and walks can be created where we least expected
it. The old men have seen other prospects from these
hills than we do. There was the old Kettell place, now
Watt’s, which I surveyed for him last winter and lotted
off, where twenty-five years ago I played horse in the
paths of a thick wood and roasted apples and potatoes
in an old pigeon-place<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[75]</a> and gathered fruit at the pie-apple
tree. A week or two after I surveyed it, it now
being rotten and going to waste, I walked there and
was surprised to find the place and prospect which I
have described.

The leaves of the larch are now yellow and falling
off. Just a month ago, I observed that the white pines
were parti-colored, green and yellow, the needles of the
previous year now falling. Now I do not observe any
yellow ones, and I expect to find that it is only for a few
weeks in the fall after the new leaves have done growing
that there are any yellow and falling,—that there
is a season when we may say the old pine leaves are now
yellow, and again, they are fallen. The trees were
not so tidy then; they are not so full now. They look
best when contrasted with a field of snow.

A rusty sparrow or two only remains to people the

It is pleasant to observe any growth in a wood.
There is the pitch pine field northeast of Beck Stow’s
Swamp, where some years ago I went a-blackberrying
and observed that the pitch pines were beginning to
come in, and I have frequently noticed since how
fairly they grew, dotting the plain as evenly as if dispersed
by art. To-day I was aware that I walked in a
pitch pine wood, which ere long, perchance, I may
survey and lot off for a wood auction and see the choppers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
at their work. There is also the old pigeon-place
field by the Deep Cut. I remember it as an open
grassy field. It is now one of our most pleasant woodland
paths. In the former place, near the edge of the
old wood, the young pines line each side of the path
like a palisade, they grow so densely. It never rains but
it pours, and so I think when I see a young grove of
pitch pines crowding each other to death in this wide
world. These are destined for the locomotive’s maw.
These branches, which it has taken so many years to
mature, are regarded even by the woodman as “trash.”
</p>

<p>
Delicate, dry, feathery (perchance fescue) grasses

I do not know what they are, but they belong to

The chickadees, if I stand long enough, hop nearer
and nearer inquisitively, from pine bough to pine

a note.
</p>

<p>
The pitcher-plant, though a little frost-bitten and
often cut off by the mower, now stands full of water in
the meadows. I never found one that had not an insect
in it.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes see well-preserved walls running straight
through the midst of high and old woods, built, of
course, when the soil was cultivated many years ago,

huge oak has grown up from a chance acorn in the soil.

the world, and they are so much alike, that when he

I saw that these must be what are called capots. They

<i>Nov. 11.</i> Gathered to-day the autumnal dandelion (?)

<p>
Some farmers’ wives use the white ashes of corn-cobs
instead of pearlash.
</p>

<p>
I am attracted by a fence made of white pine roots.
There is, or rather was, one (for it has been tipped into
the gutter this year) on the road to Hubbard’s Bridge
which I can remember for more than twenty years. It
is almost as indestructible as a wall and certainly requires
fewer repairs. It is light, white, and dry withal,
and its fantastic forms are agreeable to my eye. One
would not have believed that any trees had such snarled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
and gnarled roots. In some instances you have a coarse
network of roots as they interlaced on the surface
perhaps of a swamp, which, set on its edge, really looks
like a fence, with its paling crossing at various angles,
and root repeatedly growing into root,—a rare phenomenon
above ground,—so as to leave open spaces,
square and diamond-shaped and triangular, quite
like a length of fence. It is remarkable how white and
clean these roots are, and that no lichens, or very few,
grow on them; so free from decay are they. The different
branches of the roots continually grow into one another,
so as to make grotesque figures, sometimes rude
harps whose resonant strings of roots give a sort of
musical sound when struck, such as the earth spirit
might play on. Sometimes the roots are of a delicate
wine-color here and there, an evening tint. No line of
fence could be too long for me to study each individual
stump. Rocks would have been covered with lichens
by this time. Perhaps they are grown into one another
that they may stand more firmly.
</p>

<p>
Now is the time for wild apples. I pluck them as a
wild fruit native to this quarter of the earth, fruit of old
trees that have been dying ever since I was a boy and
are not yet dead. From the appearance of the tree
you would expect nothing but lichens to drop from it,
but underneath your faith is rewarded by finding the
ground strewn with spirited fruit. Frequented only by
the woodpecker, deserted now by the farmer, who has
not faith enough to look under the boughs.<a name='FA_78' id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[78]</a> Food for
walkers. Sometimes apples red inside, perfused with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
beautiful blush, faery food, too beautiful to eat,—apple
of the evening sky, of the Hesperides.<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79' class='fnanchor'>[79]</a>
</p>

<p>
This afternoon I heard a single cricket singing,
chirruping, in a bank, the only one I have heard for
a long time, like a squirrel or a little bird, clear and
shrill,—as I fancied, like an evening robin, singing in
this evening of the year. A very fine and poetical strain
for such a little singer. I had never before heard the
cricket so like a bird. It is a remarkable note. The
earth-song.
</p>

<p>
That delicate, waving, feathery dry grass which I saw
yesterday is to be remembered with the autumn. The
dry grasses are not dead for me. A beautiful form has
as much life at one season as another.
</p>

<p>
I notice that everywhere in the pastures minute young
fragrant life-everlasting, with only four or five flat-lying
leaves and thread-like roots, all together as big as a fourpence,
spot the ground, like winter rye and grass which
roots itself in the fall against another year. These little
things have bespoken their places for the next season.
They have a little pellet of cotton or down in their centres,
ready for an early start in the spring.
</p>

<p>
The autumnal (?) dandelion is still bright.
</p>

<p>
I saw an old bone in the woods covered with lichens,
which looked like the bone of an old settler, which yet
some little animal had recently gnawed, and I plainly
saw the marks of its teeth, so indefatigable is Nature to
strip the flesh from bones and return it to dust again.
No little rambling beast can go by some dry and ancient
bone but he must turn aside and try his teeth upon it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
An old bone is knocked about till it becomes dust;
Nature has no mercy on it. It was quite too ancient to
suggest disagreeable associations. It was like a piece of
dry pine root. It survives like the memory of a man.
With time all that was personal and offensive wears off.
The tooth of envy may sometimes gnaw it and reduce it
more rapidly, but it is much more a prey to forgetfulness.
Lichens grow upon it, and at last, in what moment
no man knows, it has completely wasted away and
ceases to be a bone any longer.
</p>

<p>
The fields are covered now with the empty cups of the
<i>Trichostema dichotomum</i>, all dry.

We walked in so pure and bright a light, so softly and
serenely bright, I thought I had never bathed in such a
golden flood, without a ripple or a murmur to it. The
west side of every wood and rising ground gleamed like
the boundary of Elysium.<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[81]</a> An adventurous spirit turns

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
their ends lost in the middle of the prairie, and some
worldly miser with a surveyor looking after his bounds,
while heaven had taken place around him, and he did
not see the angels around, but was looking for an old
post-hole in the midst of paradise. I looked again and
saw him standing in the middle of a boggy Stygian fen,
surrounded by devils, and he had found his bounds
without a doubt, three little stones where a stake had
been driven, and, looking nearer, I saw that the Prince

<i>Nov. 14.</i> Saw to-day, while surveying in the Second
Division woods, a singular round mound in a valley,
made perhaps sixty or seventy years ago. Cyrus Stow
thought it was a pigeon-bed, but I soon discovered the
coal and that it was an old coal-pit. I once mistook
one in the Maine woods for an Indian mound. The
indestructible charcoal told the tale. I had noticed
singular holes and trenches in the former wood, as if a
fox had been dug out. The sun has probably been let in
here many times, and this has been a cultivated field;
and now it is clothed in a savage dress again. The wild,
rank, luxuriant place is where mosses and lichens
abound. We find no heroes’ cairns except those of heroic
colliers, who once sweated here begrimed and dingy,
who lodged here, tending their fires, who lay on a beetle
here, perchance, to keep awake.

<i>Nov. 15.</i> I saw to-day a very perfect lichen on a rock

inches in diameter though the rock was uneven, and was

The farmers are now casting out their manure, and
removing the muck-heap from the shore of ponds where
it will be inaccessible in the winter; or are doing their
fall plowing, which destroys many insects and mellows
the soil. I also see some pulling their turnips, and even
getting in corn which has been left out notwithstanding
the crows. Those who have wood to sell, as the weather
grows colder and people can better appreciate the value
of fuel, lot off their woods and advertise a wood auction.

I am accustomed to regard the smallest brook with as
much interest for the time being as if it were the Orinoco
or Mississippi. What is the difference, I would like to
know, but mere size? And when a tributary rill empties
in, it is like the confluence of famous rivers I have read
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
of. When I cross one on a fence, I love to pause in mid-passage
and look down into the water, and study its
bottom, its little mystery. There is none so small but
you may see a pickerel regarding you with a wary eye, or
a pygmy trout glance from under the bank, or in spring,
perchance, a sucker will have found its way far up its
stream. You are sometimes astonished to see a pickerel
far up some now shrunken rill, where it is a mere puddle
by the roadside. I have stooped to drink at a clear spring
no bigger than a bushel basket in a meadow, from which
a rill was scarcely seen to dribble away, and seen lurking
at its bottom two little pickerel not so big as my finger,
sole monarchs of this their ocean, and who probably
would never visit a larger water.

In literature it is only the wild that attracts us. Dullness
is only another name for tameness. It is the untamed,
uncivilized, free, and wild thinking in Hamlet,
in the Iliad, and in all the scriptures and mythologies
that delights us,—not learned in the schools, not refined
and polished by art. A truly good book is something
as wildly natural and primitive, mysterious and marvellous,

There seems to be in the fall a sort of attempt at a

other plants begin again to spring and are
only checked by the increasing cold. There is a slight

The era of wild apples will soon be over. I wander
through old orchards of great extent, now all gone to
decay, all of native fruit which for the most part went
to the cider-mill. But since the temperance reform and
the general introduction of grafted fruit, no wild apples,
such as I see everywhere in deserted pastures, and where
the woods have grown up among them, are set out. I
fear that he who walks over these hills a century hence
will not know the pleasure of knocking off wild apples.
Ah, poor man! there are many pleasures which he will
be debarred from! Notwithstanding the prevalence of
the Baldwin and the Porter, I doubt if as extensive
orchards are set out to-day in this town as there were
a century ago, when these vast straggling cider-orchards
were planted. Men stuck in a tree then by every wall-side
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
and let it take its chance. I see nobody planting
trees to-day in such out of the way places, along almost
every road and lane and wall-side, and at the bottom of
dells in the wood. Now that they have grafted trees and
pay a price for them, they collect them into a plot by their
houses and fence them in.<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87' href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[87]</a>

newspapers are the ruling power. What Congress does
is an afterclap. Any other government is reduced to a
few marines at Fort Independence. If a man neglects
to read the Daily Times, government will go on its

<i>Nov. 19.</i> The first really cold day. I find, on breaking
off a shrub oak leaf, a little life at the foot of the leafstalk,
so that a part of the green comes off. It has not
died quite down to the point of separation, as it will do,
I suppose, before spring. Most of the oaks have lost
their leaves except on the lower branches, as if they were
less exposed and less mature there, and felt the changes
of the seasons less. The leaves have either fallen or
withered long since, yet I found this afternoon, cold as
it is,—and there has been snow in the neighborhood,—some
sprouts which had come up this year from the
stump of a young black-looking oak, covered still with
handsome fresh red and green leaves, very large and
unwithered and unwilted. It was on the south side of
Fair Haven in a warm angle, where the wood was cut
last winter and the exposed edge of the still standing
wood running north and south met the cliff at right
angles and served for a fence to keep off the wind. There
were one or two stumps here whose sprouts had fresh
leaves which transported me back to October. Yet the
surrounding shrub oak leaves were as dry and dead as
usual. There were also some minute birches only a year
old, their leaves still freshly yellow, and some young
wild apple trees apparently still growing, their leaves
as green and tender as in summer. The goldenrods,
one or more species of the white and some yellow ones,
were many of them still quite fresh, though elsewhere
they are all whitish and dry. I saw one whose top rose
above the edge of a rock, and so much of it was turned
white and dry; but the lower part of its raceme was still
yellow. Some of the white species seemed to have started
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
again as if for another spring. They had sprung up
freshly a foot or more, and were budded to blossom,
fresh and green. And sometimes on the same stem were
old and dry and white downy flowers, and fresh green
blossom-buds not yet expanded. I saw there some <i>pale</i>
blue asters still bright, and the mullein leaves still large
and green, one green to its top. And I discovered that
when I put my hand on the mullein leaves they felt
decidedly warm, but the radical leaves of the goldenrods
felt cold and clammy. There was also the columbine,
its leaves still alive and green; and I was pleased
to smell the pennyroyal which I had bruised, though this
dried up long ago. Each season is thus drawn out and
lingers in certain localities, as the birds and insects know
very well. If you penetrate to some warm recess under
a cliff in the woods, you will be astonished at the amount
of summer life that still flourishes there. No doubt
more of the summer’s life than we are aware thus slips
by and outmanœuvres the winter, gliding from fence to
fence. I have no doubt that a diligent search in proper
places would discover many more of our summer
flowers thus lingering till the snow came, than we suspect.
It is as if the plant made no preparation for winter.

Horace Hosmer was picking out to-day half a bushel
or more of a different and better kind of cranberry, as
he thought, separating them from the rest. They are
very dark red, shaded with lighter, harder and more
oblong, somewhat like the fruit of the sweet-briar or a
Canada red plum, though I have no common cranberry
to compare with them. He says that they grow apart
from the others. I must see him about it. It may prove
to be one more of those instances in which the farmer
detects a new species and makes use of the knowledge
from year to year in his profession, while the botanist
expressly devoted to such investigation has failed to
observe it.
</p>

<p>
The farmer, in picking over many bushels of cranberries

moss-covered stems were visible amid the green, in an
angle where this forest abutted on a hill covered with
shrub oaks. It was like looking into dreamland. It is

I saw Fair Haven Pond with its island, and meadow

how it could be improved. Yet I do not see what these
things can be. I begin to see such an object when I
cease to <i>understand</i> it and see that I did not realize or
appreciate it before, but I get no further than this. How
adapted these forms and colors to my eye! A meadow

various localities is greater than is supposed. If I was
surprised to find ice on the sides of the brooks, I was
much more surprised to find quite a pond in the woods,
containing an acre or more, quite frozen over so that
I walked across it. It was in a cold corner, where a pine
wood excluded the sun. In the larger ponds and the
river, of course, there is no ice yet. It is a shallow,
weedy pond. I lay down on the ice and looked through
at the bottom. The plants appeared to grow more uprightly
than on the dry land, being sustained and protected
by the water. Caddis-worms were everywhere
crawling about in their handsome quiver-like sheaths or
cases.

mixed and entangled with that we hate in one another

estranged from one another, by meeting than by absence.
Some men may be my acquaintances merely, but one
whom I have been accustomed to regard, to idealize, to
have dreams about as a friend, and mix up intimately
with myself, can never degenerate into an acquaintance.
I must know him on that higher ground or not know
him at all. We do not confess and explain, because we
would fain be so intimately related as to understand
each other without speech. Our friend must be broad.
His must be an atmosphere coextensive with the universe,

This afternoon, late and cold as it is, has been a sort
of Indian summer. Indeed, I think that we have summer
days from time to time the winter through, and that
it is often the snow on the ground makes the whole
difference. This afternoon the air was indescribably
clear and exhilarating, and though the thermometer
would have shown it to be cold, I thought that there was
a finer and purer warmth than in summer; a wholesome,
intellectual warmth, in which the body was warmed
by the mind’s contentment. The warmth was hardly
sensuous, but rather the satisfaction of existence.

I found Fair Haven skimmed entirely over, though the
stones which I threw down on it from the high bank on

the air, like a pure glass, being laid over the picture,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
the trees so tidy, stripped of their leaves; the meadows
and pastures, clothed with clean dry grass, looked as
if they had been swept; ice on the water and winter in
the air, but yet not a particle of snow on the ground.
The woods, divested in great part of their leaves, are
being ventilated. It is the season of perfect works,
of hard, tough, ripe twigs, not of tender buds and
leaves. The leaves have made their wood, and a myriad
new withes stand up all around pointing to the sky, able
to survive the cold. It is only the perennial that you
see, the iron age of the year.
</p>

<p>
These expansions of the river skim over before
the river itself takes on its icy fetters. What is the
analogy?
</p>

<p>
I saw a muskrat come out of a hole in the ice. He is a
man wilder than Ray or Melvin. While I am looking
at him, I am thinking what he is thinking of me. He is a
different sort of a man, that is all. He would dive when
I went nearer, then reappear again, and had kept open
a place five or six feet square so that it had not frozen,
by swimming about in it. Then he would sit on the edge
of the ice and busy himself about something, I could not
see whether it was a clam or not. What a cold-blooded
fellow! thoughts at a low temperature, sitting perfectly
still so long on ice covered with water, mumbling a
cold, wet clam in its shell. What safe, low, moderate
thoughts it must have! It does not get on to stilts. The
generations of muskrats do not fail. They are not
preserved by the legislature of Massachusetts.

Boats are drawn up high which will not be launched
again till spring.

</p>

<p>
There is a beautiful fine wild grass which grows in
the path in sprout land, now dry, white, and waving,
in light beds soft to the touch.
</p>

<p>
I experience such an interior comfort, far removed
from the sense of cold, as if the thin atmosphere were
rarefied by heat, were the medium of invisible flames,
as if the whole landscape were one great hearthside,
that where the shrub oak leaves rustle on the hillside, I
seem to hear a crackling fire and see the pure flame, and
I wonder that the dry leaves do not blaze into yellow
flames.
</p>

<p>
I find but little change yet on the south side of the
Cliffs; only the leaves of the wild apple are a little
frostbitten on their edges and curled dry there; but some
wild cherry leaves and blueberries are still fresh and
tender green and red, as well as all the other leaves
and plants which I noticed there the other day.
</p>

<p>
When I got up so high on the side of the Cliff the
sun was setting like an Indian-summer sun. There
was a purple tint in the horizon. It was warm on
the face of the rocks, and I could have sat till the sun
disappeared, to dream there. It was a mild sunset such
as is to be attended to. Just as the sun shines into us
warmly and serenely, our Creator breathes on us and
re-creates us.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Nov. 26.</i> An inch of snow on ground this morning,—our
first.
</p>

<p>
Went to-night to see the Indians, who are still living
in tents. Showed the horns of the moose, the black
moose they call it, that goes in lowlands. Horns three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
or four feet wide. (The red moose they say is another
kind; runs on mountains and has horns six feet wide.)
Can move their horns. The broad, flat side portions of
the horns are covered with hair, and are so soft when the
creature is alive that you can run a knife through them.<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[98]</a>
They color the lower portions a darker color by rubbing
them on alders, etc., to harden them. Make <i>kee-nong-gun</i>
or pappoose cradle, of the broad part of the horn,
putting a rim on it. Once scared, will run all day. A
dog will hang to their lips and be carried along and
swung against a tree and drop off. Always find two or
three together. Can’t run on glare ice, but can run in
snow four feet deep. The caribou can run on ice.<a name='FA_99' id='FA_99' href='#FN_99' class='fnanchor'>[99]</a> Sometimes
spear them with a sharp pole, sometimes with a
knife at the end of a pole. Signs, good or bad, from
the turn of the horns. Their caribou-horns had been
gnawed by mice in their wigwams. The moose-horns
and others are not gnawed by mice while the creature
is alive. Moose cover themselves with water, all but
noses, to escape flies.<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100' class='fnanchor'>[100]</a> About as many now as fifty
years ago.
</p>

<p>
Imitated the sounds of the moose, caribou, and deer
with a birch-bark horn, which last they sometimes
make very long. The moose can be heard eight or ten
miles sometimes,—a loud sort of bellowing sound,
clearer, more sonorous than the looing of cattle. The
caribou’s, a sort of snort; the small deer, like a lamb.
</p>

<p>
Made their clothes of the young moose-skin. Cure
the meat by smoking it; use no salt in curing it, but
when they eat it.

Their spear very serviceable. The inner, pointed
part, of a hemlock knot; the side spring pieces, of
hickory. Spear salmon, pickerel, trout,
chub, etc.; also by birch-bark light at
night, using the other end of spear as pole.
</p>

<p>
Their sled, <i>jeborgon</i> or <i>jebongon</i> (?), one
foot wide, four or five long, of thin wood
turned up in front; draw by a strong rope
of basswood bark.
</p>

<p>
Canoe of moose-hide. One hide will
hold three or four. Can be taken apart and put together
very quickly. Can take out cross-bars and bring
the sides together. A very convenient boat to carry and
cross streams with. They say they did not make birch
canoes till they had edge tools. The birches the lightest.
They think our birches the same, only second
growth.
</p>

<p>
Their <i>kee-nong-gun</i>, or cradle, has a hoop to prevent
the child being hurt when it falls. Can’t eat dirt; can
be hung up out of way of snakes.

<i>Aboak-henjo</i> [?], a birch-bark vessel for water. Can
boil meat in it with hot stones; takes a long
time. Also a vessel of birch bark, shaped like
a pan. Both ornamented by scratching the
bark, which is wrong side out. Very neatly made.
Valued our kettles much.
</p>

<p>
Did not know use of eye in axe. Put a string through
it and wore it round neck. Cut toes.
</p>

<p>
Did not like gun. Killed one moose; scared all the
rest.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
through the game and stuck in the ground slanted
over the fire, a spit. Can be eating one side while the
other is doing.
</p>

<p>
The <i>ar-tu-e-se</i>, a stick, string, and bunch of leaves,
which they toss and catch on the point of the stick.
Make great use of it. Make the clouds go off the sun
with it.
</p>

<p>
Snowshoes of two kinds; one of same shape at both
ends so that the Mohawks could not tell which way
they were going. (Put some rags in the heel-hole to

Log trap to catch many kinds of animals. Some for
bears let the log fall six or
seven feet. First there is a
frame, then the little stick
<img src="images/i-142.jpg" width="162" height="30" alt="Trap" />
which the animal
moves, presses
down, as he goes
through under the
log; then the crooked
stick is hung
over the top of the
frame, and holds
up the log by a string; the weight of the log on this
keeps the little stick up.
</p>

<p>
A drizzling and misty day this has been, melting the
snow. The mist, divided into a thousand ghostly forms,
was blowing across Walden. Mr. Emerson’s Cliff Hill,
seen from the railroad through the mist, looked like a
dark, heavy, frowning New Hampshire mountain. I
do not understand fully why hills look so much larger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
at such a time, unless, being the most distant we see and
in the horizon, we suppose them farther off and so magnify
them. I think there can be no looming about it.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Nov. 28. Thursday.</i> Cold drizzling and misty rains,
which have melted the little snow. The farmers are
beginning to pick up their dead wood. Within a day
or two the walker finds gloves to be comfortable, and
begins to think of an outside coat and of boots. Embarks
in his boots for the winter voyage.
</p>

<p>
The Indian talked about “our folks” and “your
folks,” “my grandfather” and “my grandfather’s
cousin,” Samoset.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable, but nevertheless true, as far as my
observation goes, that women, to whom we commonly
concede a somewhat finer and more sibylline nature,
yield a more implicit obedience even to their animal
instincts than men. The nature in them is stronger, the
reason weaker. There are, for instance, many young
and middle-aged men among my acquaintance—shoemakers,
carpenters, farmers, and others—who have
scruples about using animal food, but comparatively
few girls or women. The latter, even the most refined,
are the most intolerant of such reforms. I think that the
reformer of the severest, as well as finest, class will find
more sympathy in the intellect and philosophy of man
than in the refinement and delicacy of woman. It is,
perchance, a part of woman’s conformity and easy
nature. Her savior must not be too strong, stern, and
intellectual, but charitable above all things.
</p>

<p>
The thought of its greater independence and its closeness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
to nature diminishes the pain I feel when I see a
more interesting child than usual destined to be brought
up in a shanty. I see that for the present the child is
happy and is not puny, and has all the wonders of nature
for its toys. Have I not faith that its tenderness will in
some way be cherished and protected, as the buds of the
spring in the remotest and wildest wintry dell no less
than in the garden plot and summer-house?

<i>Nov. 29.</i> Still misty, drizzling weather without snow
or ice. The puffballs, with their open rays, checker
the path-side in the woods, but they are not yet dry
enough to make much dust. Damp weather in the fall
seems to cause them to crack open, <i>i. e.</i> their outer skin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
They look white like the shells of five-fingers on the
shore.
</p>

<p>
The trees and shrubs look larger than usual when seen
through the mist, perhaps because, though near, yet
being in the visible horizon and there being nothing
beyond to compare them with, we naturally magnify
them, supposing them further off.
</p>

<p>
It is very still yet in the woods. There are no leaves to
rustle, no crickets to chirp, and but few birds to sing.
</p>

<p>
The pines standing in the ocean of mist, seen from
the Cliffs, are trees in every stage of transition from the
actual to the imaginary. The near are more distinct, the
distant more faint, till at last they are a mere shadowy
cone in the distance. What, then, are these solid pines
become? You can command only a circle of thirty or
forty rods in diameter. As you advance, the trees gradually
come out of the mist and take form before your
eyes. You are reminded of your dreams. Life looks like
a dream. You are prepared to see visions. And now,
just before sundown, the night wind blows up more mist
through the valley, thickening the veil which already
hung over the trees, and the gloom of night gathers early
and rapidly around. Birds lose their way.

II
<br />
DECEMBER, 1850
<br />
(ÆT. 33)
</h2>

<p>
<i>Dec. 1.</i> It is quite mild and pleasant to-day. I saw a
little green hemisphere of moss which looked as if it
covered a stone, but, thrusting my cane into it, I found
it was nothing but moss, about fifteen inches in diameter
and eight or nine inches high. When I broke it up, it
appeared as if the annual growth was marked by successive
layers half an inch deep each. The lower ones
were quite rotten, but the present year’s quite green,
the intermediate white. I counted fifteen or eighteen.
It was quite solid, and I saw that it continued solid as it
grew by branching occasionally, just enough to fill the
newly gained space, and the tender extremities of each
plant, crowded close together, made the firm and compact
surface of the bed. There was a darker line separating
the growths, where I thought the surface had been
exposed to the winter. It was quite saturated with
water, though firm and solid.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 2.</i> The woodpeckers’ holes in the apple trees are
about a fifth of an inch deep or just through the bark and
half an inch apart. They must be the decaying trees that
are most frequented by them, and probably their work
serves to relieve and ventilate the tree and, as well, to
destroy its enemies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The barberries are shrivelled and dried. I find yet
cranberries hard and not touched by the frost.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 4. Wednesday.</i> Fair Haven Pond is now open,
and there is no snow. It is a beautiful, almost Indian-summer,
afternoon, though the air is more pure and
glassy. The shrub oak fire burns briskly as seen from
the Cliffs. The evergreens are greener than ever. I notice
the row of dwarf willows advanced into the water in
Fair Haven, three or four rods from the dry land, just
at the lowest water-mark. You can get no disease but
cold in such an atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
Though the sun is now an hour high, there is a peculiar
bright light on the pines and on their stems. The lichens
on their bark reflect it. In the horizon I see a succession
of the brows of hills, bare or covered with wood,—look
over the eyebrows of the recumbent earth. These are
separated by long valleys filled with vapory haze.
</p>

<p>
If there is a little more warmth than usual at this
season, then the beautiful air which belongs to winter is
perceived and appreciated.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 6.</i> Being at Newburyport this evening, Dr.
(H. C.?) Perkins showed me the circulations in the
nitella, which is slightly different from the chara, under
a microscope. I saw plainly the circulation, looking like
bubbles going round in each joint, up one side and down
the other of a sort of white line, and sometimes a dark-colored
mote appeared to be carried along with them.
He said that the circulation could be well seen in the
common celandine, and moreover that when a shade
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
was cast on it by a knife-blade the circulation was
reversed. Ether would stop it, or the death of the
plant.
</p>

<p>
He showed me a green clamshell,—<i>Anodon fluviatilis</i>,—which
he said was a <i>female</i> with young, found
in a pond near by.
</p>

<p>
Also the head of a Chinook or Flathead.
</p>

<p>
Also the humerus of a mylodon (of Owen) from
Oregon. Some more remains have been found in Missouri,
and a whole skeleton in Buenos Ayres. A digging
animal.
</p>

<p>
He could not catch his frogs asleep.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 8.</i> It snowed in the night of the 6th, and the
ground is now covered,—our first snow, two inches
deep. A week ago I saw cows being driven home from
pasture. Now they are kept at home. Here’s an end to
their grazing. The farmer improves this first slight
snow to accomplish some pressing jobs,—to move some
particular rocks on a drag, or the like. I perceive how
quickly he has seized the opportunity. I see no tracks
now of cows or men or boys beyond the edge of the
wood. Suddenly they are shut up. The remote pastures
and hills beyond the woods are now closed to cows and
cowherds, aye, and to cowards. I am struck by this
sudden solitude and remoteness which these places have
acquired. The dear privacy and retirement and solitude
which winter makes possible! carpeting the earth with
snow, furnishing more than woolen feet to all walkers,
cronching the snow only. From Fair Haven I see the
hills and fields, aye, and the icy woods in the corner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
shine, gleam with the dear old wintry sheen. Those
are not surely the cottages I have seen all summer.
They are some cottages which I have in my mind.
</p>

<p class="caption"><i>First Snow</i>
</p></div>

<p>
Now Fair Haven Pond is open and ground is covered
with snow and ice; a week or two ago the pond was
frozen and the ground was still bare.
</p>

<p>
Still those particular red oak leaves which I had
noticed are quite unwilted under the cliffs, and the
apple leaves, though standing in snow and ice and
incrusted with the latter, still ripe red, and <i>tender</i> fresh
green leaves.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to observe the manner in which the
plants bear their snowy burden. The dry calyx leaves,
like an oblong cup, of the <i>Trichostema dichotomum</i> have
caught the rain or melting snow, and so this little butter-boat
is filled with a frozen pure drop which stands up
high above the sides of the cup,—so many pearly drops
covering the whole plant,—in the wood-paths. The
pennyroyal there also retains its fragrance under the ice
and snow.
</p>

<p>
I find that the indigo-weed, whose <i>shade</i> still stands
and holds its black seed-vessels, is not too humble to
escape enemies. Almost every seed-vessel, which contains
half a dozen seeds or more, contains also a little
black six-legged bug about as big as a bug [<i>sic</i>], which
gnaws the seeds; and sometimes I find a grub, though
it is now cold weather and the plant is covered with ice.
Not only our peas and grain have their weevils, but
the fruit of the indigo-weed!
</p>

<p>
This evening for the first time the new moon is
reflected from the frozen snow-crust.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 13.</i> The river froze over last night,—skimmed
over.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 16.</i> Walden is open still. The river is probably
open again.
</p>

<p>
There are wild men living along the shores of the
Frozen Ocean. Who shall say that there is not as great
an interval between the civilized man and the savage
as between the savage and the brute? The undiscovered
polar regions are the home of men.
</p>

<p>
I am struck with the difference between my feet and
my hands. My feet are much nearer to foreign or inanimate
matter or nature than my hands; they are more
brute, they are more like the earth they tread on, they are
more clod-like and lumpish, and I scarcely animate them.
</p>

<p>
Last Sunday, or the 14th, I walked on Loring’s Pond
to three or four islands there which I had never visited,
not having a boat in the summer. On one containing
an acre or two, I found a low, branching shrub frozen
into the edge of the ice, with a fine spicy scent somewhat
like sweet-fern and a handsome imbricate bud.
When I rubbed the dry-looking fruit in my hands, it
felt greasy and stained them a permanent yellow, which
I could not wash out; it lasted several days, and my
fingers smelled medicinal. I conclude that it is sweet-gale,
and we named the island Myrica Island.
</p>

<p>
On those unfrequented islands, too, I noticed the red
osier or willow, that common hard-berried plant with
small red buds,<a name='FA_102' id='FA_102' href='#FN_102' class='fnanchor'>[102]</a> apparently two kinds of swamp-pink
buds, some yellow, some reddish, a brittle, rough yellowish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
bush with handsome pinkish shoots; in one place in
the meadow the greatest quantity of wild rose hips of
various forms that I ever saw, now slightly withered;
they were as thick as winterberries.
</p>

<p>
I noticed a bush covered with cocoons which were
artfully concealed by two leaves wrapped round them,
one still hanging by its stem, so that they looked like a
few withered leaves left dangling. The worm, having
first encased itself in another leaf for greater protection,
folded more loosely around itself one of the leaves of the
plant, taking care, however, to encase the leaf-stalk and
the twig with a thick and strong web of silk, so far from
depending on the strength of the stalk, which is now
quite brittle. The strongest fingers cannot break it, and
the cocoon can only be got off by slipping it up and off
the twig. There they hang themselves secure for the
winter, proof against cold and the birds, ready to become
butterflies when new leaves push forth.<a name='FA_103' id='FA_103' href='#FN_103' class='fnanchor'>[103]</a>
</p>

<p>
The snow everywhere was covered with snow-fleas
like pepper. When you hold a mass in your hand, they
skip and are gone before you know it. They are so
small that they go through and through the new snow.
Sometimes when collected they look like some powder
which the hunter has spilled in the path.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 17.</i> Flint’s Pond apparently froze completely
over last night. It is about two inches thick. Walden
is only slightly skimmed over a rod from the shore. I
noticed, where it had been frozen for some time near
the shore of Flint’s Pond and the ice was thicker and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
whiter, there were handsome spider-shaped dark places,
where the under ice had melted, and the water had
worn it running through,—a handsome figure on the
icy carpet.
</p>

<p>
I noticed when the snow first came that the days were
very sensibly lengthened by the light being reflected
from the snow. Any work which required light could
be pursued about half an hour longer. So that we may
well pray that the ground may not be laid bare by a
thaw in these short winter days.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 19.</i> Yesterday I tracked a partridge in the new-fallen
snow, till I came to where she took to flight, and
I could track her no further. I see where the snowbirds
have picked the seeds of the Roman wormwood and
other weeds and have covered the snow with the shells
and husks. The smilax berries are as plump as ever.
The catkins of the alders are as tender and fresh-looking
as ripe mulberries. The dried choke-cherries so abundant
in the swamp are now quite sweet. The witch-hazel
is covered with fruit and drops over gracefully like
a willow, the yellow foundation of its flowers still remaining.
I find the sweet-gale (<i>Myrica</i>) by the river
also. The wild apples are frozen as hard as stones, and
rattle in my pockets, but I find that they soon thaw
when I get to my chamber and yield a sweet cider.<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[104]</a> I am
astonished that the animals make no more use of them.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 22.</i> The apples are now thawed. This is their
first thawing. Those which a month ago were sour,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
crabbed, and uneatable are now filled with a rich, sweet
cider which I am better acquainted with than with wine.
And others, which have more substance, are a sweet and
luscious food,—in my opinion of more worth than
the pineapples which are imported from the torrid zone.
Those which a month ago I tasted and repented of it,
which the farmer willingly left on the tree, I am now
glad to find have the property of hanging on like the
leaves of the shrub oak. It is a way to keep cider sweet
without boiling. Let the frost come to freeze them first
solid as stones, and then the sun or a warm winter day—for
it takes but little heat—to thaw them, and they
will seem to have borrowed a flavor from heaven through
the medium of the air in which they hang. I find when I
get home that they have thawed in my pocket and the
ice is turned to cider. But I suspect that after the second
freezing and thawing they will not be so good. I bend
to drink the cup and save my lappets. What are the
half-ripe fruits of the torrid south, to this fruit matured
by the cold of the frigid north. There are those crabbed
apples with which I cheated my companion, and kept a
smooth face to tempt him to eat. Now we both greedily
fill our pockets with them, and grow more social with
their wine. Was there one that hung so high and sheltered
by the tangled branches that our sticks could not
dislodge it? It is a fruit never brought to market that
I am aware of,—quite distinct from the apple of the
markets, as from dried apple and cider. It is not every
winter that produces it in perfection.<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105' class='fnanchor'>[105]</a>
</p>

<p>
In winter I can explore the swamps and ponds. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
a dark-aired winter day, yet I see the summer plants
still peering above the snow. There are but few tracks
in all this snow. It is the Yellow Knife River or the
Saskatchewan. The large leafy lichens on the white
pines, especially on the outside of the wood, look almost
a golden yellow in the light reflected from the snow,
while deeper in the wood they are ash-colored. In the
swamps the dry, yellowish-colored fruit of the poison
dogwood hangs like jewelry on long, drooping stems.
It is pleasant to meet it, it has so much character relatively
to man. Here is a stump on which a squirrel has
sat and stripped the pine cones of a neighboring tree.
Their cores and scales lie all around. He knew that
they contained an almond<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[106]</a> before the naturalist did.
He has long been a close observer of Nature; opens her
caskets. I see more tracks in the swamps than elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 23.</i> Here is an old-fashioned snow-storm. There
is not much passing on railroads. The engineer says it
is three feet deep above. Walden is frozen, one third of
it, though I thought it was all frozen as I stood on the
shore on one side only. There is no track on the Walden
road. A traveller might cross it in the woods and not
be sure it was a road. As I pass the farmers’ houses I
observe the cop [<i>sic</i>] of the sled propped up with a stick
to prevent its freezing into the snow. The needles of the
pines are drooping like cockerels’ feathers after a rain,
and frozen together by the sleety snow. The pitch pines
now bear their snowy fruit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I can discern a faint foot or sled path sooner when
the ground is covered with snow than when it is bare.
The depression caused by the feet or the wheels is more
obvious; perhaps the light and shade betray it, but
I think it is mainly because the grass and weeds rise
above it on each side and leave it blank, and a blank
space of snow contrasts more strongly with the woods
or grass than bare or beaten ground.
</p>

<p>
Even the surface of the snow is wont to be in waves
like billows of the ocean.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 24.</i> In walking across the Great Meadows to-day
on the snow-crust, I noticed that the fine, dry snow
which was blown over the surface of the frozen field,
when I [looked] westward over it or toward the sun,
looked precisely like steam curling up from its surface,
as sometimes from a wet roof when the sun comes out
after a rain.
</p>

<p>
The snow catches only in the hollows and against the
reeds and grass, and never rests there, but when it has
formed a broad and shallow drift or a long and narrow
one like a winrow on the ice, it blows away again
from one extremity, and leaves often a thin, tongue-like
projection at one end, some inches above the firm
crust.
</p>

<p>
I observe that there are many dead pine-needles
sprinkled over the snow, which had not fallen before.
</p>

<p>
Saw a shrike pecking to pieces a small bird, apparently
a snowbird. At length he took him up in his bill,
almost half as big as himself, and flew slowly off with
his prey dangling from his beak. I find that I had not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
associated such actions with my idea of birds. It was
not birdlike.
</p>

<p>
It is never so cold but it melts somewhere. Our mason
well remarked that he had sometimes known it to be
melting and freezing at the same time on a particular
side of a house; while it was melting on the roof the
icicles [were] forming under the eaves. It is always
melting and freezing at the same time when icicles are
formed.
</p>

<p>
Our thoughts are with those among the dead into
whose sphere we are rising, or who are now rising into
our own. Others we inevitably forget, though they be
brothers and sisters. Thus the departed may be nearer
to us than when they were present. At death our friends
and relations either draw nearer to us and are found
out, or depart further from us and are forgotten. Friends
are as often brought nearer together as separated by
death.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Dec. 26. Thursday.</i> The pine woods seen from the
hilltops, now that the ground is covered with snow, are
not green but a dark brown, greenish-brown perhaps.
You see dark patches of wood. There are still half a
dozen fresh ripe red and glossy oak leaves left on the
bush under the Cliffs.
</p>

<p>
Walden not yet more than half frozen over.

When waiting by night for elephants to approach a

The rhinoceros-birds stick their bills in the ear of
the rhinoceros and wake him up when the hunter is
approaching. They live on ticks and other parasitic
insects on his body. He perfectly understands their
warning. He has chased a rhinoceros many miles on
horseback and fired many shots before he fell, and all
the while the birds remained by him, perched on his
back and sides, and as each bullet struck him they
ascended about six feet into the air, uttering a cry of
alarm, and then resumed their position. Sometimes
they were swept off his back by branches of trees. When
the rhinoceros was shot at midnight, they have remained
by his body thinking him asleep, and on the hunter’s
approaching in the morning have tried to wake him up.

<i>Dec. 31.</i> I observe that in the cut by Walden Pond
the sand and stones fall from the overhanging bank
and rest on the snow below; and thus, perchance, the
stratum deposited by the side of the road in the winter
can permanently be distinguished from the summer
one by some faint seam, to be referred to the peculiar
conditions under which it was deposited.
</p>

<p>
The pond has been frozen over since I was there last.
</p>

<p>
Certain meadows, as Heywood’s, contain warmer
water than others and are slow to freeze. I do not
remember to have crossed this with impunity in all
places. The brook that issues from it is still open
completely, though the thermometer was down to eight
below zero this morning.

The blue jays evidently notify each other of the

great chattering about it, and so communicate the
alarm to other birds and to beasts.

<h2>
III
<br />
JANUARY-APRIL, 1851
<br />
(ÆT. 33)
</h2>

<p>
<i>Jan. 2.</i> Saw at Clinton last night a room at the
gingham-mills which covers one and seven-eighths acres
and contains 578 looms, not to speak of spindles, both
throttle and mule. The rooms all together cover three
acres. They were using between three and four hundred
horse-power, and kept an engine of two hundred horse-power,
with a wheel twenty-three feet in diameter and
a band ready to supply deficiencies, which have not
often occurred. Some portion of the machinery—I
think it was where the cotton was broken up, lightened
up, and mixed before being matted together—revolved
eighteen hundred times in a minute.
</p>

<p>
I first saw the pattern room where patterns are made
by a hand loom. There were two styles of warps ready
for the woof or filling. The operator must count the
threads of the woof, which in the mill is done by the machinery.
It was the ancient art of weaving, the shuttle
flying back and forth, putting in the filling. As long as
the warp is the same, it is but one “style,” so called.
</p>

<p>
The cotton should possess a long staple and be clean
and free from seed. The Sea Island cotton has a long
staple and is valuable for thread. Many bales are
thoroughly mixed to make the goods of one quality.
The cotton is then torn to pieces and thoroughly lightened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
up by cylinders armed with hooks and by fans;
then spread, a certain weight on a square yard, and
matted together, and torn up and matted together again
two or three times over; then the matted cotton fed to
a cylindrical card, a very thin web of it, which is gathered
into a copper trough, making six (the six-card
machines) flat, rope-like bands, which are united into
one at the railway head and drawn. And this operation
of uniting and drawing or stretching goes on from one
machine to another until the thread is spun, which
is then dyed (calico is printed after being woven),—having
been wound off on to reels and so made into
skeins,—dyed and dried by steam; then, by machinery,
wound on to spools for the warp and the woof. From
a great many spools the warp is drawn off over cylinders
and different-colored threads properly mixed and arranged.
Then the ends of the warp are drawn through
the harness of the loom by hand. The operator knows
the succession of red, blue, green, etc., threads, having
the numbers given her, and draws them through the
harness accordingly, keeping count. Then the woof is
put in, or it is <i>woven</i>!! Then the inequalities or nubs
are picked off by girls. If <i>they</i> discover any imperfection,
they tag it, and if necessary the wages of the weaver are
reduced. Now, I think, it is passed over a red-hot iron
cylinder, and the fuzz singed off, then washed with
wheels with cold water; then the water forced out by
centrifugal force within horizontal wheels. Then it is
starched, the ends stitched together by machinery; then
stretched smooth, dried, and ironed by machinery;
then measured, folded, and packed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This the agent, Forbes, says is the best gingham-mill
in this country. The goods are better than the imported.
The English have even stolen their name Lancaster
Mills, calling them “Lancasterian.”
</p>

<p>
The machinery is some of it peculiar, part of the
throttle spindles (?) for instance.
</p>

<p>
The coach-lace-mill, only place in this country where
it is made by machinery; made of thread of different
materials, as cotton, worsted, linen, as well as colors,
the raised figure produced by needles inserted woof
fashion. Well worth examining further. Also pantaloon
stuffs made in same mill and dyed after being woven,
the woolen not taking the same dye with the cotton;
hence a slight parti-colored appearance. These goods
are sheared, <i>i. e.</i> a part of the nap taken off, making
them smoother. Pressed between pasteboards.
</p>

<p>
The Brussels carpets made at the carpet-factory said
to be the best in the world. Made like coach lace, only
wider.
</p>

<p>
Erastus (?) Bigelow inventor of what is new in the
above machinery; and, with his brother and another,
owner of the carpet-factory.
</p>

<p>
I am struck by the fact that no work has been shirked
when a piece of cloth is produced. Every thread has
been counted in the finest web; it has not been matted
together. The operator has succeeded only by patience,
perseverance, and fidelity.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The direction in which a railroad runs, though
intersecting another at right angles, may cause that
one will be blocked up with snow and the other be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
comparatively open even for great distances, depending
on the direction of prevailing winds and valleys. There
are the Fitchburg and Nashua &amp; Worcester.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 4.</i> The longest silence is the most pertinent
question most pertinently put. Emphatically silent. The
most important question, whose answers concern us
more than any, are never put in any other way.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult for two strangers, mutually well disposed,
so truly to bear themselves toward each other
that a feeling of falseness and hollowness shall not soon
spring up between them. The least anxiety to behave
truly vitiates the relation. I think of those to whom I am
at the moment truly related, with a joy never expressed
and never to be expressed, before I fall asleep at night,
though I am hardly on speaking terms with them these
years. When I think of it, I am truly related to them.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 5.</i> The catkins of the alders are now frozen
stiff!!
</p>

<p>
Almost all that my neighbors call good I believe in
my soul to be bad. If I repent of anything, it is of my
good behavior. What demon possessed me that I behaved
so well? You may say the wisest thing you can,
old man,—you who have lived seventy years, not without
honor of a kind,—I hear an irresistible voice, the
voice of my destiny, which invites me away from all that.<a name='FA_111' id='FA_111' href='#FN_111' class='fnanchor'>[111]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 7.</i> The snow is sixteen inches deep at least, but
[it] is a mild and genial afternoon, as if it were the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
beginning of a January thaw. Take away the snow and
it would not be winter but like many days in the fall.
The birds acknowledge the difference in the air; the
jays are more noisy, and the chickadees are oftener
heard.
</p>

<p>
Many herbs are not crushed by the snow.
</p>

<p>
I do not remember to have seen fleas except when the
weather was mild and the snow damp.
</p>

<p>
I must live above all in the present.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Science does not embody all that men know, only
what is for men of science. The woodman tells me how
he caught trout in a box trap, how he made his trough
for maple sap of pine logs, and the spouts of sumach or
white ash, which have a large pith. He can relate his
facts to human life.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge of an unlearned man is living and
luxuriant like a forest, but covered with mosses and
lichens and for the most part inaccessible and going
to waste; the knowledge of the man of science is like
timber collected in yards for public works, which still
supports a green sprout here and there, but even this is
liable to dry rot.
</p>

<p>
I felt my spirits rise when I had got off the road
into the open fields, and the sky had a new appearance.
I stepped along more buoyantly. There was a warm
sunset over the wooded valleys, a yellowish tinge on the
pines. Reddish dun-colored clouds like dusky flames
stood over it. And then streaks of blue sky were seen
here and there. The life, the joy, that is in blue sky
after a storm! There is no account of the blue sky in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
history. Before I walked in the ruts of travel; now I
adventured. This evening a fog comes up from the
south.
</p>

<p>
If I have any conversation with a scamp in my walk,
my afternoon is wont to be spoiled.
</p>

<p>
The squirrels and apparently the rabbits have got
all the frozen apples in the hollow behind Miles’s.
The rabbits appear to have devoured what the squirrels
dropped and left. I see the tracks of both leading from
the woods on all sides to the apple trees.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 8.</i> The smilax (green-briar) berries still hang
on like small grapes. The thorn of this vine is very
perfect, like a straight dagger.
</p>

<p>
The light of the setting sun falling on the snow-banks
to-day made them glow almost yellow.
</p>

<p>
The hills seen from Fair Haven Pond make a wholly
new landscape; covered with snow and yellowish
green or brown pines and shrub oaks, they look higher
and more massive. Their white mantle relates them to
the clouds in the horizon and to the sky. Perchance
what is light-colored looks loftier than what is dark.
</p>

<p>
You might say of a very old and withered man or
woman that they hung on like a shrub oak leaf, almost
to a second spring. There was still a little life in the
heel of the leaf-stalk.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Jan. 10.</i> The snow shows how much of the mountains
in the horizon are covered with forest. I can also
see plainer as I stand on a hill what proportion of the
township is in forest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Got some excellent frozen-thawed apples off of
Annursnack, soft and luscious as a custard and free
from worms and rot. Saw a partridge budding, but
they did not appear to have pecked the apples.
</p>

<p>
There was a remarkable sunset; a mother-of-pearl
sky seen over the Price farm; some small clouds, as
well as the edges of large ones, most brilliantly painted
with mother-of-pearl tints through and through. I never
saw the like before. Who can foretell the sunset,—what
it will be?
</p>

<p>
The near and bare hills covered with snow look
like mountains, but the mountains in the horizon do
not look higher than hills.
</p>

<p>
I frequently see a hole in the snow where a partridge
has squatted, the mark or form of her tail very distinct.
</p>

<p>
The chivalric and heroic spirit, which once belonged
to the chevalier or rider only, seems now to reside in the
walker. To represent the chivalric spirit we have no
longer a knight, but a walker, errant.<a name='FA_112' id='FA_112' href='#FN_112' class='fnanchor'>[112]</a> I speak not of
pedestrianism, or of walking a thousand miles in a
thousand successive hours.

<p>
The Adam who daily takes a turn in his garden.
</p>

<p>
Methinks I would not accept of the gift of life, if I were
required to spend as large a portion of it sitting foot up
or with my legs crossed, as the shoemakers and tailors
do. As well be tied neck and heels together and cast into
the sea. Making acquaintance with my extremities.
</p>

<p>
I have met with but one or two persons in the course
of my life who understood the art of taking walks daily,—not
[to] exercise the legs or body merely, nor barely to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
recruit the spirits, but positively to exercise both body
and spirit, and to succeed to the highest and worthiest
ends by the abandonment of all specific ends,—who had
a genius, so to speak, for sauntering. And this word
“saunter,” by the way, is happily derived “from idle
people who roved about the country [in the Middle
Ages]<a name='FA_113' id='FA_113' href='#FN_113' class='fnanchor'>[113]</a> and asked charity under pretence of going <i>à la
Sainte Terre</i>,” to the Holy Land, till, perchance, the
children exclaimed, “There goes a <i>Sainte-Terrer</i>,” a

[Perhaps I am more] than usually jealous of my
freedom. I feel that my connections with and obligations
to society are at present very slight and transient.
Those slight labors which afford me a livelihood, and
by which I am serviceable to my contemporaries, are as
yet a pleasure to me, and I am not often reminded that
they are a necessity. So far I am successful, and only
he is successful in his business who makes that pursuit
which affords him the highest pleasure sustain him.
But I foresee that if my wants should be much increased
the labor required to supply them would become a
drudgery. If I should sell both my forenoons and
afternoons to society, neglecting my peculiar calling, there
would be nothing left worth living for. I trust that I
shall never thus sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.<a name='FA_115' id='FA_115' href='#FN_115' class='fnanchor'>[115]</a>

F. Andrew Michaux says that “the species of large
trees are much more numerous in North America than
in Europe: in the United States there are more than
one hundred and forty species that exceed thirty feet in
height; in France there are but thirty that attain this
size, of which eighteen enter into the composition of the
forests, and seven only are employed in building.”<a name='FA_116' id='FA_116' href='#FN_116' class='fnanchor'>[116]</a>

English literature from the days of the minstrels to

wilderness is a greenwood, her wild man a Robin Hood.

I went some months ago to see a panorama of the
Rhine. It was like a dream of the Middle Ages. I
floated down its historic stream in something more than
imagination, under bridges built by the Romans and
repaired by later heroes, past cities and castles whose
very names were music to me,—made my ears tingle,—and
each of which was the subject of a legend. There
seemed to come up from its waters and its vine-clad
hills and valleys a hushed music as of crusaders departing
for the Holy Land. There were Ehrenbreitstein and
Rolandseck and Coblentz, which I knew only in history.
I floated along through the moonlight of history under
the spell of enchantment. It was as if I remembered
a glorious dream,—as if I had been transported to a
heroic age and breathed an atmosphere of chivalry.
Those times appeared far more poetic and heroic than
these.

Guyot says, “The Baltic Sea has a depth of only 120

and England, the greatest depth does not exceed 300
feet.” The most extensive forest, “the most gigantic
wilderness,” on the earth is in the basin of the Amazon,
and extends almost unbroken more than fifteen hundred
miles. South America the kingdom of palms; nowhere
a greater number of species. “This is a sign of the preponderating

<i>Feb. 9.</i> The last half of January was warm and
thawy. The swift streams were open, and the muskrats

leaving their shells on the ice. We had now forgotten

spring. Fishermen improved the warmer weather

the autumn landscape with a thin layer of snow upon it;

<i>Feb. 12. Wednesday.</i> A beautiful day, with but little
snow or ice on the ground. Though the air is sharp, as
the earth is half bare the hens have strayed to some
distance from the barns. The hens, standing around
their lord and pluming themselves and still fretting a
little, strive to fetch the year about.
</p>

<p>
A thaw has nearly washed away the snow and raised
the river and the brooks and flooded the meadows,
covering the old ice, which is still fast to the bottom.
</p>

<p>
I find that it is an excellent walk for variety and
novelty and wildness, to keep round the edge of the
meadow,—the ice not being strong enough to bear and
transparent as water,—on the bare ground or snow,
just between the highest water mark and the present
water line,—a narrow, meandering walk, rich in unexpected
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
views and objects. The line of rubbish which
marks the higher tides—withered flags and reeds and
twigs and cranberries—is to my eyes a very agreeable
and significant line, which Nature traces along the
edge of the meadows. It is a strongly marked, enduring
natural line, which in summer reminds me that
the water has once stood over where I walk. Sometimes
the grooved trees tell the same tale. The wrecks of the
meadow, which fill a thousand coves, and tell a thousand
tales to those who can read them. Our prairial,
mediterranean shore. The gentle rise of water around
the trees in the meadow, where oaks and maples stand
far out in the sea, and young elms sometimes are seen
standing close around some rock which lifts its head
above the water, as if protecting it, preventing it from
being washed away, though in truth they owe their origin
and preservation to it. It first invited and detained
their seed, and now preserves the soil in which they
grow. A pleasant reminiscence of the rise of waters, to
go up one side of the river and down the other, following
this way, which meanders so much more than the river
itself. If you cannot go on the ice, you are then gently
compelled to take this course, which is on the whole
more beautiful,—to follow the sinuosities of the meadow.
Between the highest water mark and the present water
line is a space generally from a few feet to a few rods in
width. When the water comes over the road, then my
spirits rise,—when the fences are carried away. A prairial
walk. Saw a caterpillar crawling about on the snow.
</p>

The earth is so bare that it makes an impression on
me as if it were catching cold.

</p>

<p>
I saw to-day something new to me as I walked along
the edge of the meadow. Every half-mile or so along the
channel of the river I saw at a distance where apparently
the ice had been broken up while freezing by the
pressure of other ice,—thin cakes of ice forced up on
their edges and reflecting the sun like so many mirrors,
whole fleets of shining sails, giving a very lively appearance
to the river,—where for a dozen rods the flakes
of ice stood on their edges, like a fleet beating up-stream
against the sun, a fleet of ice-boats.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable that the cracks in the ice on the
meadows sometimes may be traced a dozen rods from
the water through the snow in the neighboring fields.
</p>

<p>
It is only necessary that man should start a fence that
Nature should carry it on and complete it. The farmer
cannot plow quite up to the rails or wall which he
himself has placed, and hence it often becomes a hedgerow
and sometimes a coppice.
</p>

<p>

of the excitement which the roar of a cataract produces.
It is allied to the circulation in our veins. We
have a waterfall which corresponds even to Niagara
somewhere within us.<a name='FA_137' id='FA_137' href='#FN_137' class='fnanchor'>[137]</a> It is astonishing what a rush and
tumult a slight inclination will produce in a swollen
brook. How it proclaims its glee, its boisterousness,
rushing headlong in its prodigal course as if it would
exhaust itself in half an hour! How it spends itself! I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
would say to the orator and poet, Flow freely and
<i>lavishly</i> as a brook that is full,—without stint. Perchance
I have stumbled upon the origin of the word
“lavish.” It does not hesitate to tumble down the
steepest precipice and roar or tinkle as it goes, for fear it
will exhaust its fountain. The impetuosity of descending
water even by the slightest inclination! It seems to
flow with ever increasing rapidity.

It is difficult to believe what philosophers assert, that
it is merely a difference in the form of the elementary
particles—as whether they are square or globular—which
makes the difference between the steadfast, everlasting,

which tumbles down it.

It is refreshing to walk over sprout-lands, where oak
and chestnut sprouts are mounting swiftly up again into
the sky, and already perchance their sere leaves begin to
rustle in the breeze and reflect the light on the hillsides.

<i>Feb. 13.</i> Skated to Sudbury. A beautiful, summer-like
day. The meadows were frozen just enough to bear.
Examined now the fleets of ice-flakes close at hand.
They are a very singular and interesting phenomenon,
which I do not remember to have seen. I should say
that when the water was frozen about as thick as pasteboard,
a violent gust had here and there broken it up,
and while the wind and waves held it up on its edge, the
increasing cold froze it in firmly. So it seemed, for the
flakes were for the most part turned one way; <i>i. e.</i>
standing on one side, you saw only their edges, on
another—the northeast or southwest—their sides.
They were for the most part of a triangular form, like
a shoulder[<i>sic</i>]-of-mutton sail, slightly scalloped, like
<img src="images/i-192.jpg" width="432" height="52" alt="Flakes" />
shells. They looked like a fleet of a thousand mackerel-fishers
under a press of sail careering before a smacking
breeze. Sometimes the sun and wind had reduced them
to the thinness of writing-paper, and they fluttered and
rustled and tinkled merrily. I skated through them and
strewed their wrecks around. They appear to have been
elevated expressly to reflect the sun like mirrors, to adorn
the river and attract the eye of the skater. Who will say
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
that their principal end is not answered when they excite
the admiration of the skater? Every half-mile or mile,
as you skate up the river, you see these crystal fleets.
Nature is a great imitator and loves to repeat herself.
She wastes her wonders on the town. It impresses me
as one superiority in her art, if art it may be called, that
she does not require that man appreciate her, takes no
steps to attract his attention.
</p>

<p>
The trouble is in getting on and off the ice; when you
are once on you can go well enough. It melts round the
edges.
</p>

<p>
Again I saw to-day, half a mile off in Sudbury, a
sandy spot on the top of a hill, where I prophesied that
I should find traces of the Indians. When within a dozen
rods, I distinguished the foundation of a lodge, and
merely passing over it, I saw many fragments of the
arrowhead stone. I have frequently distinguished these
localities half a mile [off], gone forward, and picked up
arrowheads.
</p>

<p>
Saw in a warm, muddy brook in Sudbury, quite open
and exposed, the skunk-cabbage spathes above water.
The tops of the spathes were frost-bitten, but the fruit
[<i>sic</i>] sound. There was one partly expanded. The first
flower of the season; for it is a flower. I doubt if there is
[a] month without its flower. Examined by the botany
all its parts,—the first flower I have seen. The <i>Ictodes
fœtidus</i>.

Also mosses, mingled red and green. The red will

As for antiquities, one of our old deserted country
roads, marked only by the parallel fences and cellar-hole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
with its bricks where the last inhabitant died, the victim
of intemperance, fifty years ago, with its bare and
exhausted fields stretching around, suggests to me an
antiquity greater and more remote from the America of
the newspapers than the tombs of Etruria. I insert the
rise and fall of Rome in the interval. This is the decline
and fall of the Roman Empire.

In society, in the best institutions of men, I remark a

<i>Feb. 14.</i> Consider the farmer, who is commonly
regarded as the healthiest man. He may be the toughest,
but he is not the healthiest. He has lost his elasticity;
he can neither run nor jump. Health is the free
use and command of all our faculties, and equal development.
His is the health of the ox, an overworked buffalo.
His joints are stiff. The resemblance is true even
in particulars. He is cast away in a pair of cowhide
boots, and travels at an ox’s pace. Indeed, in some
places he puts his foot into the skin of an ox’s shin. It
would do him good to be thoroughly shampooed to
make him supple. His health is an insensibility to all
influence. But only the healthiest man in the world is
sensible to the finest influence; he who is affected by
more or less of electricity in the air.

One afternoon in the fall, November 21st, I saw Fair
Haven Pond with its island and meadow; between the
island and the shore, a strip of perfectly smooth water
in the lee of the island; and two hawks sailing over it;
and something more I saw which cannot easily be described,
which made me say to myself that the landscape
could not be improved. I did not see how it could
be improved. Yet I do not know what these things can
be; I begin to see such objects only when I leave off
understanding them, and afterwards remember that I
did not appreciate them before. But I get no further
than this. How adapted these forms and colors to our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
eyes, a meadow and its islands! What are these things?
Yet the hawks and the ducks keep so aloof, and nature

There is a difference between eating for strength and

a march on the cooks of Paris. The eater of meat must
come to this. This is better than stall-fed cattle and
slaughter-house pork. Possibly they derive a certain

<i>Feb. 15.</i> Fatal is the discovery that our friend is
fallible, that he has prejudices. He is, then, only prejudiced
in our favor. What is the value of his esteem
who does not justly esteem another?
</p>

<p>
Alas! Alas! when my friend begins to deal in confessions,
breaks silence, makes a theme of friendship
(which then is always something past), and descends to
merely human relations! As long as there is a spark of
love remaining, cherish that alone. Only <i>that</i> can be
kindled into a flame. I thought that friendship, that
love was still possible between [us]. I thought that we
had not withdrawn very far asunder. But now that my
friend rashly, thoughtlessly, profanely speaks, <i>recognizing</i>

the distance between us, that distance seems infinitely

<i>Feb. 16.</i> Do we call this the land of the free? What
is it to be free from King George the Fourth and continue
the slaves of prejudice? What is it [to] be born
free and equal, and not to live? What is the value of
any political freedom, but as a means to moral freedom?
Is it a freedom to be slaves or a freedom to be
free, of which we boast? We are a nation of politicians,
concerned about the outsides of freedom, the means
and outmost defenses of freedom. It is our children’s
children who may perchance be essentially free. We
tax ourselves unjustly. There is a part of us which is
not represented. It is taxation without representation.
We quarter troops upon ourselves. In respect to virtue
or true manhood, we are essentially provincial, not
metropolitan,—mere Jonathans. We are provincial,
because we do not find at home our standards; because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
we do not worship truth but the reflection of truth;
because we are absorbed in and narrowed by trade
and commerce and agriculture, which are but means and
not the end. We are essentially provincial, I say, and
so is the English Parliament. Mere country bumpkins

The finest manners in the world are awkwardness
and fatuity when contrasted with a finer intelligence.
They appear but as the fashions of past days,—mere
courtliness, small-clothes, and knee-buckles,—have
the vice of getting out of date; an attitude merely. The
vice of manners is that they are continually deserted
by the character; they are cast-off clothes or shells,
claiming the respect of the living creature. You are
presented with the shells instead of the meat, and it
is no excuse generally that, in the case of some fish,
the shells are of more worth than the meat. The man
who thrusts his manners upon me does as if he were
to insist on introducing me to his cabinet of curiosities,
when I wish to see himself. Manners are conscious;
character is unconscious.<a name='FA_144' id='FA_144' href='#FN_144' class='fnanchor'>[144]</a>

There is little or nothing to be remembered written
on the subject of getting an honest living. Neither the
New Testament nor Poor Richard speaks to our condition.
I cannot think of a single page which entertains,
much less answers, the questions which I put to
myself on this subject. How to make the getting our
living poetic! for if it is not poetic, it is not life but
death that we get. Is it that men are too disgusted with
their experience to speak of it? or that commonly they
do not question the common modes? The most practically
important of all questions, it seems to me, is
how shall I get my living, and yet I find little or nothing
said to the purpose in any book. Those who are living
on the interest of money inherited, or dishonestly, <i>i. e.</i>
by false methods, acquired, are of course incompetent
to answer it. I consider that society with all its arts,
has done nothing for us in this respect. One would
think, from looking at literature, that this question had
never disturbed a solitary individual’s musings. Cold
and hunger seem more friendly to my nature than those
methods which men have adopted and advise to ward
them off.<a name='FA_145' id='FA_145' href='#FN_145' class='fnanchor'>[145]</a> If it were not that I desire to do something

get a living by the modes men propose.

Niepce, a Frenchman, announced that “no substance
can be exposed to the sun’s rays without undergoing
a chemical change.” Granite rocks and stone
structures and statues of metal, etc., “are,” says Robert
Hunt, “all alike destructively acted upon during the
hours of sunshine, and, but for provisions of nature no
less wonderful, would soon perish under the delicate
touch of the most subtile of the agencies of the universe.”
But Niepce showed, says Hunt, “that those
bodies which underwent this change during daylight
possessed the power of restoring themselves to their
original conditions during the hours of night, when
this excitement was no longer influencing them.” So,
in the case of the daguerreotype, “the picture which
we receive to-night, unless we adopt some method of
securing its permanency, fades away before the morning,
and we try to restore it in vain.” (Infers) “the
hours of darkness are as necessary to the inorganic
creation as we know night and sleep are to the organic
kingdom.” Such is the influence of “actinism,” that
power in the sun’s rays which produces a chemical
effect.<a name='FA_146' id='FA_146' href='#FN_146' class='fnanchor'>[146]</a>

<i>Feb. 25.</i> A very windy day. A slight snow which
fell last night was melted at noon. A strong, gusty
wind; the waves on the meadows make a fine show.
I saw at Hubbard’s Bridge that all the ice had been
blown up-stream from the meadows, and was collected
over the channel against the bridge in large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
cakes. These were covered and intermingled with a
remarkable quantity of the meadow’s crust. There
was no ice to be seen up-stream and no more downstream.
</p>

<p>
The meadows have been flooded for a fortnight, and
this water has been frozen barely thick enough to bear
once only. The old ice on the meadows was covered
several feet deep. I observed from the bridge, a few
rods off northward, what looked like an island directly
over the channel. It was the crust of the meadow afloat.
I reached [it] with a little risk and found it to be four
rods long by one broad,—the surface of the meadow
with cranberry vines, etc., all connected and in their
natural position, and no ice visible but around its edges.
It appeared to be the frozen crust (which was separated
from the unfrozen soil as ice is from the water beneath),
buoyed up (?), perchance, by the ice around its edges
frozen to the stubble. Was there any pure ice under
it? Had there been any above it? Will frozen meadow
float? Had ice which originally supported it from above
melted except about the edges? When the ice melts or
the soil thaws, of course it falls to the bottom, wherever
it may be. Here is another agent employed in the distribution
of plants. I have seen where a smooth shore
which I frequented for bathing was in one season
strewn with these hummocks, bearing the button-bush
with them, which have now changed the character of
the shore. There were many rushes and lily-pad stems
on the ice. Had the ice formed about them as they grew,
broken them off when it floated away, and so they were
strewn about on it?

<i>Feb. 26. Wednesday.</i> Examined the floating meadow
again to-day. It is more than a foot thick, the under
part much mixed with ice,—ice and muck. It appeared
to me that the meadow surface had been heaved
by the frost, and then the water had run down and
under it, and finally, when the ice rose, lifted it up,
wherever there was ice enough mixed with it to float it.
I saw large cakes of ice with other large cakes, the
latter as big as a table, on top of them. Probably the
former rose while the latter were already floating about.
The plants scattered about were bulrushes and lily-pad
stems.

was a very handsome tree, about twenty-five feet high.
E. Wood thinks that he has lost the surface of two acres
of his meadow by the ice. Got fifteen cartloads out of
a hummock left on another meadow. Blue-joint was
introduced into the first meadow where it did not grow
before.

amounts to anything more definite than a novel and
grand surprise, or a sudden revelation of the insufficiency
of all that we had called knowledge before; an
indefinite sense of the grandeur and glory of the universe.

The following bears on the floating ice which has
risen from the bottom of the meadows. Robert Hunt
says: “Water conducts heat downward but very slowly;
a mass of ice will remain undissolved but a few inches
under water on the surface of which ether or any other
inflammable body is burning. If ice swam beneath the
surface, the summer sun would scarcely have power to
thaw it; and thus our lakes and seas would be gradually
converted into solid masses.”

a Hindoo dynasty, perchance, such things as the Nineteenth
Century, with all its improvements, may come
and go again. Nothing makes a deep and lasting impression
but what is weighty.

CARRYING OFF SIMS
</p>

<p>
A recent English writer (De Quincey),<a name='FA_152' id='FA_152' href='#FN_152' class='fnanchor'>[152]</a> endeavoring
to account for the atrocities of Caligula and Nero,
their monstrous and anomalous cruelties, and the general
servility and corruption which they imply, observes
that it is difficult to believe that “the descendants of
a people so severe in their habits” as the Romans
had been “could thus rapidly” have degenerated and
that, “in reality, the citizens of Rome were at this
time a new race, brought together from every quarter
of the world, but especially from Asia.” A vast “proportion
of the ancient citizens had been cut off by the
sword,” and such multitudes of emancipated slaves from
Asia had been invested with the rights of citizens “that,
in a single generation, Rome became almost transmuted
into a baser metal.” As Juvenal complained,
“the Orontes ... had mingled its impure waters with
those of the Tiber.” And “probably, in the time of
Nero, not one man in six was of pure Roman descent.”
Instead of such, says another, “came Syrians, Cappadocians,
Phrygians, and other enfranchised slaves.”
“These in half a century had sunk so low, that Tiberius
pronounced her [Rome’s]<a name='FA_153' id='FA_153' href='#FN_153' class='fnanchor'>[153]</a> very senators to be
<i>homines ad servitutem natos</i>, men born to be slaves.”<a name='FA_154' id='FA_154' href='#FN_154' class='fnanchor'>[154]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
</p>

<p>
So one would say, in the absence of particular genealogical
evidence, that the vast majority of the inhabitants
of the city of Boston, even those of senatorial dignity,—the
Curtises, Lunts, Woodburys, and others,—were
not descendants of the men of the Revolution,—the
Hancocks, Adamses, Otises,—but some “Syrians,
Cappadocians, and Phrygians,” merely, <i>homines ad
servitutem natos</i>, men born to be slaves. But I would
have done with comparing ourselves with our ancestors,
for on the whole I believe that even they, if somewhat
braver and less corrupt than we, were not men of so
much principle and generosity as to go to war in behalf
of another race in their midst. I do not believe that the
North will soon come to blows with the South on this
question. It would be too bright a page to be written in
the history of the race at present.

There is such an officer, if not such a man, as the
Governor of Massachusetts. What has he been about
the last fortnight? He has probably had as much as he
could do to keep on the fence during this moral earthquake.
It seems to me that no such keen satire, no such
cutting insult, could be offered to that man, as the absence
of all inquiry after him in this crisis. It appears
to [have] been forgotten that there was such a man or
such an office. Yet no doubt he has been filling the
gubernatorial chair all the while. One Mr. Boutwell,—so
named, perchance, because he goes about well to

<p>
In ’75 two or three hundred of the inhabitants of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
Concord assembled at one of the bridges with arms in
their hands to assert the right of three millions to tax
themselves, to have a voice in governing themselves.
About a week ago the authorities of Boston, having the
sympathy of many of the inhabitants of Concord, assembled
in the gray of the dawn, assisted by a still larger
armed force, to send back a perfectly innocent man, and
one whom they knew to be innocent, into a slavery as
complete as the world ever knew. Of course it makes
not the least difference—I wish you to consider this—who
the man was,—whether he was Jesus Christ or
another,—for inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of
these his brethren ye did it unto him. Do you think
<i>he</i> would have stayed here in liberty and let the black
man go into slavery in his stead? They sent him back,
I say, to live in slavery with other three millions—mark
that—whom the same slave power, or slavish
power, North and South, holds in that condition,—three
millions who do not, like the first mentioned,
assert the right to govern themselves but simply to run
away and stay away from their prison.
</p>

<p>
Just a week afterward, those inhabitants of this town
who especially sympathize with the authorities of Boston
in this their deed caused the bells to be rung and
the cannon to be fired to celebrate the courage and
the love of liberty of those men who assembled at the
bridge. As if <i>those</i> three millions had fought for the
right to be free themselves, but to hold in slavery three
million others. Why, gentlemen, even consistency,
though it is much abused, is sometimes a virtue. Every
humane and intelligent inhabitant of Concord, when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
or she heard those bells and those cannon, thought not
so much of the events of the 19th of April, 1775, as of
the event of the 12th of April, 1851.
</p>

<p>
I wish my townsmen to consider that, whatever the
human law may be, neither an individual nor a nation
can ever deliberately commit the least act of injustice
without having to pay the penalty for it. A government
which deliberately enacts injustice, and persists
in it!—it will become the laughing-stock of the
world.
</p>

<p>
Much as has been said about American slavery, I
think that commonly we do not yet realize what slavery
is. If I were seriously to propose to Congress to make
mankind into sausages, I have no doubt that most would
smile at my proposition and, if any believed me to be
in earnest, they would think that I proposed something
much worse than Congress had ever done. But, gentlemen,
if any of you will tell me that to make a man into a
sausage would be much worse—would be any worse—than
to make him into a slave,—than it was then to
enact the fugitive slave law,—I shall here accuse him
of foolishness, of intellectual incapacity, of making a
distinction without a difference. The one is just as
sensible a proposition as the other.<a name='FA_156' id='FA_156' href='#FN_156' class='fnanchor'>[156]</a>
</p>

<p>
When I read the account of the carrying back of the
fugitive into slavery, which was read last Sunday evening,
and read also what was not read here, that the man
who made the prayer on the wharf was Daniel Foster
of <i>Concord</i>, I could not help feeling a slight degree of
pride because, of all the towns in the Commonwealth,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
Concord was the only one distinctly named as being
represented in that new tea-party, and, as she had a
place in the first, so would have a place in this, the last
and perhaps next most important chapter of the History
of Massachusetts. But my second feeling, when I
reflected how short a time that gentleman has resided
in this town, was one of doubt and shame, because the
<i>men</i> of Concord in recent times have done nothing to
entitle them to the honor of having their town named in
such a connection.
</p>

<p>
I hear a good deal said about trampling this law
under foot. Why, one need not go out of his way to do
that. This law lies not at the level of the head or the
reason. Its natural habitat is in the dirt. It was bred
and has its life only in the dust and mire, on a level with
the feet; and he who walks with freedom, unless, with
a sort of quibbling and Hindoo mercy, he avoids treading
on every venomous reptile, will inevitably tread on
it, and so trample it under foot.
</p>

<p>
It has come to this, that the friends of liberty, the
friends of the slave, have shuddered when they have
understood that his fate has been left to the legal tribunals,
so-called, of the country to be decided. The people
have no faith that justice will be awarded in such
a case. The judge may decide this way or that; it is a
kind of accident at best. It is evident that he is not
a competent authority in so important a case. I would
not trust the life of my friend to the judges of all the
Supreme Courts in the world put together, to be sacrificed
or saved by precedent. I would much rather trust
to the sentiment of the people, which would itself be a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
precedent to posterity. In their vote you would get
something worth having at any rate, but in the other
case only the trammelled judgment of an individual, of
no significance, be it which way it will.
</p>

<p>
I think that recent events will be valuable as a criticism
on the administration of justice in our midst, or
rather as revealing what are the true sources of justice
in any community. It is to some extent fatal to the
courts when the people are compelled to go behind the
courts. They learn that the courts are made for fair
weather and for very civil cases.<a name='FA_157' id='FA_157' href='#FN_157' class='fnanchor'>[157]</a>

As for measures to be adopted, among others I would
advise abolitionists to make as earnest and vigorous
and persevering an assault on the press, as they have
already made, and with effect too, on the church. The
church has decidedly improved within a year or two,
aye, even within a fortnight; but the press is, almost
without exception, corrupt. I believe that in this country
the press exerts a greater and a more pernicious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
influence than the church. We are not a religious
people, but we are a nation of politicians. We do not
much care for, we do not read, the Bible, but we do care
for and we do read the newspaper. It is a bible which
we read every morning and every afternoon, standing
and sitting, riding and walking. It is a bible which
every man carries in his pocket, which lies on every
table and counter, which the mail and thousands of
missionaries are continually dispersing. It is the only
book which America has printed, and is capable of
exerting an almost inconceivable influence for good or
for bad. The editor is [a] preacher whom you voluntarily
support. Your tax is commonly one cent, and
it costs nothing for pew hire. But how many of these
preachers preach the truth? I repeat the testimony of
many an intelligent traveller, as well as my own convictions,
when I say that probably no country was ever
ruled by so mean a class of tyrants as are the editors
of the periodical press in <i>this</i> country. Almost without
exception the tone of the press is mercenary and servile.
The <i>Commonwealth</i>, and the <i>Liberator</i>, are the only
papers, as far as I know, which make themselves heard
in condemnation of the cowardice and meanness of the
authorities of Boston as lately exhibited. The other
journals, almost without exception,—as the <i>Advertiser</i>,
the <i>Transcript</i>, the <i>Journal</i>, the <i>Times</i>, <i>Bee</i>, <i>Herald</i>,
etc.,—by their manner of referring to and speaking of
the Fugitive Slave Law or the carrying back of the slave,
insult the common sense of the country. And they do
this for the most part, because they think so to secure
the approbation of their patrons, and also, one would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
think, because they are not aware that a sounder sentiment
prevails to any extent.

But, thank fortune, this preacher can be more easily
reached by the weapons of the reformer than could the
recreant priest. The <i>free</i> men of New England have

free, would use it to ring the bells and fire the cannon to
celebrate their liberty. It reminded me of the Roman
Saturnalia, on which even the slaves were allowed to
take some liberty. So some of you took the liberty to
ring and fire. That was the extent of your freedom;
and when the sound of the bells died away, your liberty
died away also, and when the powder was all expended,
your liberty went off with the smoke. Nowadays men
wear a fool’s-cap and call it a liberty-cap. The joke

<i>April 29.</i> Every man, perhaps, is inclined to think
his own situation singular in relation to friendship. Our
thoughts would imply that other men <i>have</i> friends,
though we have not. But I do not know of two whom
I can speak of as standing in this relation to one another.
Each one makes a standing offer to mankind, “On
such and such terms I will give myself to you;” but it is
only by a miracle that his terms are ever accepted.

I distinguish between my <i>actual</i> and my <i>real</i> communication
with individuals. I <i>really</i> communicate with
my friends and congratulate myself and them on our
relation and rejoice in their presence and society
oftenest when they are personally absent. I remember
that not long ago, as I laid my head on my pillow for
the night, I was visited by an inexpressible joy that I
was permitted to know and be related to such mortals
as I was then actually related to; and yet no special
event that I could think of had occurred to remind me
of any with whom I was connected, and by the next
noon, perchance, those essences that had caused me
joy would have receded somewhat. I experienced a
remarkable gladness in the thought that they existed.
Their existence was then blessed to me. Yet such has
never been my actual waking relation to any.

Every one experiences that, while his relation to another
actually may be one of distrust and disappointment,

intercourse is based on this experience of success.

The very dogs and cats incline to affection in their

Even the cat which lies on a rug all day commences
to prowl about the fields at night, resumes her ancient
forest habits. The most tenderly bred grimalkin steals
forth at night,—watches some bird on its perch for an
hour in the furrow, like a gun at rest. She catches no
cold; it is her nature. Caressed by children and cherished
with a saucer of milk. Even she can erect her
back and expand her tail and spit at her enemies like
the wild cat of the woods. Sweet Sylvia!

What is the singing of birds, or any natural sound,

Does not the history of chivalry and knight-errantry
suggest or point to another relation to woman than
leads to marriage, yet an elevating and all-absorbing
one, perchance transcending marriage? As yet men
know not one another, nor does man know woman.
</p>

<p>
I am sure that the design of my maker when he has
brought me nearest to woman was not the propagation,
but rather the maturation, of the species. Man is capable
of a love of woman quite transcending marriage.

I observe that the <i>New York Herald</i> advertises situations
wanted by “respectable young women” by the
column, but never by respectable young men, rather
“intelligent” and “smart” ones; from which I infer
that the public opinion of New York does not require
young men to be respectable in the same sense in which
it requires young women to be so.

spice-wood, near William Wheeler’s in Lincoln, resembling
the witch-hazel. It is remarkable that this aromatic
shrub, though it grows by the roadside and does
not hide itself, may be, as it were, effectually concealed,
though it blossoms every spring. It may be observed
only once in many years.

In regard to purity, I do not know whether I am
much worse or better than my acquaintances. If I confine
my thought to myself, I appear, whether by constitution
or by education, irrevocably impure, as if I
should be shunned by my fellow-men if they knew me
better, as if I were of two inconsistent natures; but
again, when I observe how the mass of men speak of
woman and of chastity,—with how little love and
reverence,—I feel that so far I am unaccountably better
than they. I think that none of my acquaintances
has a greater love and admiration for chastity than I
have. Perhaps it is necessary that one should actually
stand low himself in order to reverence what is high
in others.

All distant landscapes seen from hilltops are veritable
pictures, which will be found to have no actual existence
to him who travels to them. “’T is distance lends enchantment
to the view.” It is the bare landscape without
this depth of atmosphere to glass it. The distant
river-reach seen in the north from the Lincoln Hill, high
in the horizon, like the ocean stream flowing round
Homer’s shield, the rippling waves reflecting the light, is
unlike the same seen near at hand. Heaven intervenes
between me and the object. By what license do I call
it Concord River. It redeems the character of rivers to
see them thus. They were worthy then of a place on
Homer’s shield.

<p>
As I looked to-day from Mt. Tabor in Lincoln to
the Waltham hill, I saw the same deceptive slope, the
near hill melting into the further inseparably, indistinguishably;
it was one gradual slope from the base
of the near hill to the summit of the further one, a
succession of copse-woods, but I knew that there intervened
a valley two or three miles wide, studded with
houses and orchards and drained by a considerable
stream. When the shadow of a cloud passed over the
nearer hill, I could distinguish its shaded summit
against the side of the other.

<p class="p2">
I had in my mind’s eye a silent gray tarn which I
had seen the summer before high up on the side of a
mountain, Bald Mountain, where the half-dead spruce
trees stood far in the water draped with wreathy mist
as with usnea moss, made of dews, where the mountain
spirit bathed; whose bottom was high above the surface
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
of other lakes. Spruces whose dead limbs were
more in harmony with the mists which draped them.

The forenoon that I moved to my house, a poor old
lame fellow who had formerly frozen his feet hobbled
off the road, came and stood before my door with one
hand on each door-post, looking into the house, and
asked for a drink of water. I knew that rum or something
like it was the only drink he loved, but I gave
him a dish of warm pond water, which was all I had,
nevertheless, which to my astonishment he drank, being
used to drinking.

<i>May 6. Monday.</i> The Harivansa describes a “substance
called <i>Poroucha</i>, a spiritual substance known
also under the name of Mahat, spirit united to the
five elements, soul of being, now enclosing itself in a
body like ours, now returning to the eternal body; it
is mysterious wisdom, the perpetual sacrifice made by
the virtue of the <i>Yoga</i>, the fire which animates animals,
shines in the sun, and is mingled with all bodies. Its
nature is to be born and to die, to pass from repose to
movement. The spirit led astray by the senses, in the
midst of the creation of Brahma, engages itself in works
and knows birth, as well as death. The organs of the
senses are its paths, and its work manifests itself in this
creation of Brahma. Thought tormented by desires,
is like the sea agitated by the wind. Brahma has said:
the heart filled with strange affections is to be here
below purified by wisdom. Here below even, clothed
already as it were in a luminous form, let the spirit,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
though clogged by the bonds of the body, prepare for
itself an abode sure and permanent.

“He who would obtain final emancipation must abstain
from every exterior action. The operation which
conducts the pious and penitent Brahman to the knowledge
of the truth, is all interior, intellectual, mental.
They are not ordinary practices which can bring light
into the soul.
</p>

<p>
“The Mouni who desires his final emancipation will
have care evening and morning to subdue his senses,
to fix his mind on the divine essence, and to transport
himself by the force of his soul to the eternal abode of
Vichnou. Although he may have engaged in works, he
does not wear the clog of them, because his soul is not
attached to them. A being returns to life in consequence
of the affection which he has borne for terrestrial things:
he finds himself emancipated, when he has felt only
indifference for them.

“The Richis mingle with nature, which remains strange

“Thus the Yogin, absorbed in contemplation, contributes

original matter.”

I rejoice that horses and steers have to [be] <i>broken</i>
before they can be made the slaves of men, and that men
themselves have some wild oats still left to sow before
they become submissive members of society. Undoubtedly
all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization,
and because the majority, like dogs and sheep, are tame
by inherited disposition, is no reason why the others
should have their natures broken, that they may be
reduced to the same level. Men are in the main alike,
but they were made several in order that [they] might be
various. If a low use is to be served, one man will do
nearly or quite as well as another; if a high one, individual
excellence is to be regarded. Any man can stop
a hole to keep the wind away, but no other man can serve
that use which the author of this illustration did. Confucius

sheep tanned.” But it is not the part of a true culture to
tame tigers, any more than it is to make sheep ferocious.
It is evident, then, that tanning their skins for shoes and
the like is not the best use to which they can be put.<a name='FA_166' id='FA_166' href='#FN_166' class='fnanchor'>[166]</a>

How important is a constant intercourse with nature
and the contemplation of natural phenomena to the
preservation of moral and intellectual health! The discipline
of the schools or of business can never impart
such serenity to the mind. The philosopher contemplates
human affairs as calmly and from as great a

He approaches the study of mankind with great

By taking the ether the other day I was convinced how
far asunder a man could be separated from his senses.
You are told that it will make you unconscious, but no
one can imagine what it is to be unconscious—how far
removed from the state of consciousness and all that we
call “this world”—until he has experienced it. The
value of the experiment is that it does give you experience
of an interval as between one life and another,—a
greater space than you ever travelled. You are a sane
mind without organs,—groping for organs,—which
if it did not soon recover its old senses would get new
ones. You expand like a seed in the ground. You exist
in your roots, like a tree in the winter. If you have an
inclination to travel, take the ether; you go beyond the
furthest star.
</p>

It is not necessary for them to take ether, who in their

If there is a more splendid moonlight than usual, only

on the outskirts of the town, enjoying the still majesty

of this miracle, that they too are silently worshipping
this manifestation of divinity elsewhere. But when I go
into the house I am undeceived; they are absorbed in
checkers or chess or novel, though they may have been
advertised of the brightness through the shutters.

In the moonlight night what intervals are created!
The rising moon is related to the near pine tree which
rises above the forest, and we get a juster notion of distance.
The moon is only somewhat further off and on
one side. There may be only three objects,—myself,
a pine tree, and the moon, nearly equidistant.

<i>May 18. Sunday.</i> Lady’s-slipper almost fully blossomed.
The log of a canoe birch on Fair Haven, cut
down the last winter, more than a foot in diameter at the
stump; one foot in diameter at ten feet from the ground.
I observed that all parts of the epidermis exposed to the
air and light were white, but the inner surfaces, freshly
exposed, were a buff or salmon-color. Sinclair says that
in winter it is white throughout. But this was cut before
the sap flowed??! Was there any sap in the log? I counted
about fifty rings. The shrub oaks are now blossoming.
The scarlet tanagers are come. The oak leaves of all
colors are just expanding, and are more beautiful than
most flowers. The hickory buds are almost leaves. The
landscape has a new life and light infused into it. The
deciduous trees are springing, to countenance the pines,
which are evergreen. It seems to take but one summer
day to fetch the summer in. The turning-point between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
winter and summer is reached. The birds are in full blast.
There is a peculiar freshness about the landscape; you
scent the fragrance of new leaves, of hickory and sassafras,
etc. And to the eye the forest presents the tenderest
green. The blooming of the apple trees is becoming
general.

The <i>Pinus mitis</i>, yellow pine, or spruce pine, or short-leaved
pine. A two-leaved pine widely diffused, but not
found northward beyond certain districts of Connecticut
and Massachusetts. In New Jersey fifty or sixty feet
high and fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter. Sometimes
three leaves on fresh shoots; smallest of pine
cones; seeds cast first year. Very excellent wood for
houses, masts, decks, yards, beams, and cabins, next in
durability to the long-leaved pine. Called at Liverpool
New York pine. Its regular branches make it to be
called spruce pine sometimes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Pinus australis</i>, or long-leaved pine, an invaluable
tree, called yellow pine, pitch pine, and broom pine
where it grows; in the North, Southern pine and red
pine; in England, Georgia pitch pine. First appears
at Norfolk, Virginia; thence stretches six hundred miles
southwest. Sixty or seventy feet high, by fifteen to eighteen
inches; leaves a foot long, three in a sheath;
negroes use them for brooms. Being stronger, more
compact and durable, because the resin is equally
distributed, and also fine-grained and susceptible of
a bright polish, it is preferred to every other pine. In
naval architecture, most esteemed of all pines,—keels,
beams, side-planks, trunnels, etc. For decks preferred
to yellow pine,—and flooring houses. Sold for more
at Liverpool than any other pine. Moreover it supplies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
nearly all the resinous matter used and exported. Others
which contain much pitch are more dispersed. At present
(1819) this business is confined to North Carolina.
</p>

<p>
M. says the branches of resinous trees consist almost
wholly of <i>wood</i>, of which the organization is even more
perfect than in the body of the tree. They use dead
wood for the tar, etc., in which it has accumulated.
</p>

Vt., are the most northerly limits of the pitch pine or

<p>
White pine (<i>P. Strobus</i>) most abundant between
forty-third and forty-seventh degrees, one hundred and
eighty feet by seven and eight twelfths the largest.
“The loftiest and most valuable” of the productions
of the New Hampshire forest.
</p>

<p>
The black spruce is called <i>épinette noire</i> and <i>épinette
à la bière</i> in Canada. From its strength best substitute
for oak and larch. Used here for rafters and
preferred to hemlock; tougher than white pine, but
more liable to crack.
</p>

<p>
The white spruce (<i>Abies alba</i>) called <i>épinette blanche</i>
in Canada. Not so large as the last and wood inferior.
</p>

<p>
Hemlock spruce (<i>Abies Canadensis</i>) called <i>pérusse</i>
in Canada. In Maine, Vermont, and upper New
Hampshire, three fourths of the evergreen woods, the
rest being black spruce. Belongs to cold regions; begins
to appear about Hudson’s Bay. Its fibre makes
the circuit of stocks fifteen or twenty inches in diameter
in ascending five or six feet. Old trees have their
circles separated, and the boards are <i>shaky</i>. Decays
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
rapidly when exposed to the air. It is firmer, though
coarser, than the white pine; affords tighter hold to
nails. Used in Maine for threshing-floors, resisting
indentation. Most common use sheathing of houses, to
be covered with clapboards. Used for laths.
</p>

<p>
White cedar (<i>Cupressus thyoides</i>). “The perfect
wood resists the succession of dryness and moisture
longer than that of any other species;” hence for shingles.
</p>

<p>
Larch (<i>Larix Americana</i>); in Canada <i>épinette rouge</i>;
<i>tamarack</i> by the Dutch. Male aments appear before
the leaves. Wood superior to any pine or spruce in
strength and durability. Used in Maine for knees.
</p>

Cedar of Lebanon (<i>Larix cedrus</i>) largest and most
majestic of resinous trees of the Old World and one
of the finest vegetable productions of the globe.
</p>

Cedar Island in Lake Champlain northern limit
of red cedar (<i>Juniperus Virginiana</i>). Eastward, not
beyond Wiscasset. Seeds mature at beginning of fall
and <i>sown at once</i>; shoot next spring. Gin made from
them.
</p>

<p>
Arbor-vitæ (<i>Thuya occidentalis</i>), the only species of
<i>Thuya</i> in the New World. Lake St. John in Canada
its northern limit; abounds between 48° 50´ and 45°.
The posts last thirty-five or forty years, and the rails
sixty, or three or four times as long as those of any other
species. In northern New England States the best for
fences; last longer in clay than sand.

The superiority of mahogany in the fineness of its
grain and its hardness, which make it susceptible of a
brilliant polish. Native trees in Northern States used

<p class="p2">
<i>May 20. Tuesday.</i> There is, no doubt, a perfect
analogy between the life of the human being and that
of the vegetable, both of the body and the mind. The
botanist Gray says:—
</p>

<p>
“The organs of plants are of two sorts:—1. Those
of <i>Vegetation</i>, which are concerned in growth,—by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
which the plant takes in the aërial and earthy matters
on which it lives, and elaborates them into the materials
of its own organized substance; 2. Those of
<i>Fructification</i> or <i>Reproduction</i>, which are concerned with
the propagation of the species.”
</p>

<p>
So is it with the human being. I am concerned first
to come to my <i>Growth</i>, intellectually and morally (and
physically, of course, as a means to this, for the body
is the symbol of the soul), and then to bear my <i>Fruit</i>,
do my <i>Work</i>, <i>propagate</i> my kind, not only physically
but <i>morally</i>, not only in body but in mind.
</p>

<p>
“The organs of vegetation are the <i>Root</i>, <i>Stem</i>, and
<i>Leaves</i>. The <i>Stem</i> is the axis and original basis of the
plant.”
</p>

<p>
“The first point of the stem preëxists in the embryo
(<i>i. e.</i> in the rudimentary plantlet contained within the
seed): it is here called the radicle.” Such is the rudiment
of mind, already partially developed, more than a
bud, but pale, having never been exposed to the light,
and slumbering coiled up, packed away in the seed,
unfolded [<i>sic</i>].
</p>

<p>
Consider the still pale, rudimentary, infantine, radicle-like
thoughts of some students, which who knows
what they might expand to, if they should ever come
to the light and air, if they do not become rancid and
perish in the seed. It is not every seed that will survive
a thousand years. Other thoughts further developed,
but yet pale and languid, like shoots grown in a cellar.
</p>

<p>
“The plant ... develops from the first in two
opposite directions, <i>viz.</i> upwards [to expand in the
light and air] to produce and continue the stem (or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
<i>ascending axis</i>), and downwards [avoiding the light]<a name='FA_169' id='FA_169' href='#FN_169' class='fnanchor'>[169]</a> to
form the root (or <i>descending</i> axis). The former is ordinarily
or in great part aërial, the latter subterranean.”
</p>

<p>
So the mind develops from the first in two opposite
directions: upwards to expand in the light and air;
and downwards avoiding the light to form the root.
One half is aërial, the other subterranean. The mind
is not well balanced and firmly planted, like the oak,
which has not as much root as branch, whose roots like
those of the white pine are slight and near the surface.
One half of the mind’s development must still be root,—in
the embryonic state, in the womb of nature, more
unborn than at first. For each successive new idea or
bud, a new rootlet in the earth. The growing man penetrates
yet deeper by his roots into the womb of things.
The infant is comparatively near the surface, just covered
from the light; but the man sends down a tap-root
to the centre of things.
</p>

<p>
The mere logician, the mere reasoner, who weaves
his arguments as a tree its branches in the sky,—nothing
equally developed in the roots,—is overthrown
by the first wind.
</p>

<p>
As with the roots of the plant, so with the roots of
the mind, the branches and branchlets of the root “are
mere repetitions for the purpose of multiplying the absorbing
points, which are chiefly the growing or newly
formed extremities, sometimes termed <i>spongelets</i>. It
bears no other organs.”
</p>

<p>
So this organ of the mind’s development, the <i>Root</i>,
bears no organs but spongelets or absorbing points.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Annuals, which perish root and all the first season,
especially have slender and thread-like fibrous roots.
But biennials are particularly characterized by distended,
fleshy roots containing starch, a stock for future
growth, to be consumed during their second or flowering
season,—as carrots, radishes, turnips. Perennials
frequently have many thickened roots clustered together,
tuberous or palmate roots, fasciculated or
clustered as in the dahlia, pæony, etc.
</p>

<p>
Roots may spring from any part of the stem under
favorable circumstances; “that is to say in darkness
and moisture, as when covered by the soil or resting
on its surface.”
</p>

<p>
That is, the most clear and ethereal ideas (Antæus-like)
readily ally themselves to the earth, to the primal
womb of things. They put forth roots as soon as
branches; they are eager to be <i>soiled</i>. No thought soars
so high that it sunders these apron-strings of its mother.
The thought that comes to light, that pierces the empyrean
on the other side, is wombed and rooted in darkness,
a moist and fertile darkness,—its roots in Hades
like the tree of life. No idea is so soaring but it will
readily put forth roots. Wherever there is an air-and-light-seeking
bud about to expand, it may become in
the earth a darkness-seeking root. Even swallows and
birds-of-paradise <i>can</i> walk on the ground. To quote the
sentence from Gray entire: “Roots not only spring from
the root-end of the primary stem in germination, but also
from any subsequent part of the stem under favorable
circumstances, that is to say, in darkness and moisture,
as when covered by the soil or resting on its surface.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
</p>

<p>
No thought but is connected as strictly as a flower,
with the earth. The mind flashes not so far on one side
but its rootlets, its spongelets, find their way instantly
on the other side into a moist darkness, uterine,—a low
bottom in the heavens, even miasma-exhaling to such
immigrants as are not acclimated. A cloud is uplifted
to sustain its roots. Imbosomed in clouds as in a chariot,
the mind drives through the boundless fields of space.
Even there is the dwelling of Indra.
</p>

<p>
I might here quote the following, with the last—of
roots: “They may even strike in the open air and
light, as is seen in the copious aërial rootlets by which
the Ivy, the Poison Ivy, and the Trumpet Creeper
climb and adhere to the trunks of trees or other bodies;
and also in Epiphytes or Air-plants, of most warm regions,
which have no connection whatever with the soil,
but germinate and grow high in air on the trunks or
branches of trees, etc.; as well as in some terrestrial
plants, such as the Banian and Mangrove, that send
off aërial roots from their trunks or branches, which
finally reach the ground.”
</p>

<p>
So, if our light-and-air-seeking tendencies extend too
widely for our original root or stem, we must send downward
new roots to ally us to the earth.
</p>

<p>
Also there are parasitic plants which have their roots
in the branches or roots of other trees, as the mistletoe,
the beech-drops, etc. There are minds which so have
their roots in other minds as in the womb of nature,—if,
indeed, most are not such?!
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>May 21. Wednesday.</i> Yesterday I made out the black
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
and the white ashes. A double male white ash in Miles’s
Swamp, and two black ashes with sessile leaflets. A
female white ash near railroad, in Stow’s land. The
white ashes by Mr. Pritchard’s have no blossoms, at
least as yet.
</p>

<p>
If I am right, the <i>black</i> ash is improperly so called,
from the color of its bark being lighter than the white.
Though it answers to the description in other respects,
even to the elder-like odor of the leaves, I should like
still to see a description of the yellow ash which grows
in made [<i>sic</i>].
</p>

<p>
The day before yesterday I found the male sassafras
in abundance but no female.
</p>

<p>
The leaves of my new pine on Merriam’s or Pine Hill
are of intermediate length between those of the yellow
pine and the Norway pine. I can find no cone to distinguish
the tree by; but, as the leaves are <i>semicylindrical</i>
and not <i>hollowed</i> I think it must be the red or Norway
Pine, though it does not look very red, and is <i>spruce</i>!
answering perhaps to the description of the yellow pine,
which is sometimes called spruce pine.
</p>

<p>
To-day examined the flowers of the <i>Nemopanthes
Canadensis</i>,—a genus of a single species, says Emerson.
It bears the beautiful crimson velvety berry of the
swamps, and is what I have heard called the cornel.
Common name wild holly.
</p>

<p class="p2">
I have heard now within a few days that peculiar
dreaming sound of the frogs<a name='FA_170' id='FA_170' href='#FN_170' class='fnanchor'>[170]</a> which belongs to the
summer,—their midsummer night’s dream.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Only that thought and that expression are good which
are musical.
</p>

<p>
I think that we are not commonly aware that man is
our contemporary,—that in this strange, outlandish
world, so barren, so prosaic, fit not to live in but merely
to pass through, that even here so divine a creature as
man does actually live. Man, the crowning fact, the god
we know. While the earth supports so rare an inhabitant,
there is somewhat to cheer us. Who shall say that
there is no God, if there is a <i>just</i> man. It is only within
a year that it has occurred to me that there is such a
being actually existing on the globe. Now that I perceive
that it is so, many questions assume a new aspect.
We have not only the idea and vision of the divine ourselves,
but we have brothers, it seems, who have this
idea also. Methinks my neighbor is better than I, and
his thought is better than mine. There is a representative
of the divinity on earth, of [whom] all things fair
and noble are to be expected. We have the material of
heaven here. I think that the standing miracle to man
is man. Behind the paling yonder, come rain or shine,
hope or doubt, there dwells a man, an actual being who
can sympathize with our sublimest thoughts.
</p>

<p>
The revelations of nature are infinitely glorious and
cheering, hinting to us of a remote future, of possibilities
untold; but startlingly near to us some day we find a
fellow-man.
</p>

<p>
The frog had eyed the heavens from his marsh, until
his mind was filled with visions, and he saw more than
belongs to this fenny earth. He mistrusted that he was
become a dreamer and visionary. Leaping across the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
swamp to his fellow, what was his joy and consolation to
find that he too had seen the same sights in the heavens,
he too had dreamed the same dreams!
</p>

<p>
From nature we turn astonished to this <i>near</i> but supernatural
fact.
</p>

<p>
I think that the existence of man in nature is the
divinest and most startling of all facts. It is a fact which
few have realized.
</p>

<p>
I can go to my neighbors and meet on ground as elevated
as we could expect to meet upon if we were now
in heaven.
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i11">“And we live,</p>
<p>We of this mortal mixture, in the same law</p>
<p>As the pure colorless intelligence</p>

</div></div>

<p>
I do not think that man can understand the <i>importance</i>
of man’s existence, its bearing on the other phenomena
of life, until it shall become a remembrance to him the
survivor that such a being or such a race once existed
on the earth. Imagine yourself alone in the world, a
musing, wondering, reflecting spirit, <i>lost</i> in thought, and
imagine thereafter the creation of man!—man made
in the image of God!
</p>

<p>
Looking into a book on dentistry the other day, I observed
a list of authors who had written on this subject.
There were Ran and Tan and Yungerman, and I was
impressed by the fact that there was nothing in a name.
It was as if they had been named by the child’s rigmarole
of <i>Iery [wiery] ichery van, tittle-tol-tan</i>, etc. I saw
in my mind a herd of wild creatures swarming over the
earth, and to each one its own herdsman had affixed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
some barbarous name, or sound, or syllables, in his own
dialect,—so in a thousand languages. Their names
were seen to be as meaningless exactly as Bose or Tray,
the names of dogs.<a name='FA_171' id='FA_171' href='#FN_171' class='fnanchor'>[171]</a> Men get named no better.
</p>

<p>
We seem to be distinct ourselves, never repeated,
and yet we bear no names which express a proportionate
distinctness; they are quite accidental. Take away
their names, and you leave men a wild herd, distinguished
only by their individual qualities. It is as if you were
to give names in the Caffre dialect to the individuals in
a herd of spring-boks or gnus.
</p>

<p>
We have but few patronymics, but few Christian
names, in proportion to the number of us. Is it that
men ceased to be original when genuine and original
names ceased to be given. Have we not enough character
to establish a new patronymic.
</p>

<p>
Methinks it would be some advantage to philosophy
if men were <i>named</i> merely in the gross, as they are
known. It would only be necessary to know the genus
and, perchance, the species and variety, to know the
individual.
</p>

<p>
I will not allow <i>mere names</i> to make distinctions for
me, but still see men in herds for all <i>them</i>. A familiar
name cannot make a man less strange to me. It may
be given to a savage who retains in secret his own wild
title earned in the woods. I see that the neighbor who
wears the familiar epithet of William or Edwin takes
it off with his jacket. It does not adhere to him when
asleep or when in anger, or aroused by any passion or
inspiration. I seem to hear pronounced by some of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
kin at such a time his original wild name in some
jaw-breaking or else melodious tongue. As the names
of the Poles and Russians are to us, so are ours to
them.
</p>

<p>
Our names are as cheap as the names given to dogs.
We know what are dogs’ names; we know what are
men’s names. Sometimes it would be significant and
truer, it would lead to generalization, it would avoid
exaggeration, to say, “<i>There was a man</i> who said or
did—,” instead of designating him by some familiar,
but perchance delusive, name.
</p>

<p>
We hardly believe that every private soldier in a
Roman army had a name of his own.<a name='FA_172' id='FA_172' href='#FN_172' class='fnanchor'>[172]</a>
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to see how the names of famous men
are repeated,—even of great poets and philosophers.
The poet is not known to-day even by his neighbors to
be more than a common man. He is perchance the butt
of many. The proud farmer looks down [on] and boorishly
ignores him, or regards him as a loafer who treads
down his grass, but perchance in course of time the
poet will have so succeeded that some of the farmer’s
posterity, though equally boorish with their ancestor,
will bear the poet’s name. The boor names his boy
Homer, and so succumbs unknowingly to the bard’s
victorious fame. Anything so fine as poetic genius he
cannot more directly recognize. The unpoetic farmer
names his child Homer.

<p class="p2">
<i>May 23. Friday.</i> And wilder still there grows elsewhere,
I hear, a native and aboriginal crab-apple, <i>Malus</i>
(as Michaux, or, as Emerson has it, <i>Pyrus</i>) <i>coronaria</i>
in Southern States, and also <i>angustifolia</i> in the Middle
States; whose young leaves “have a bitter and slightly
aromatic taste” (Michaux), whose beautiful flowers
perfume the air to a great distance. “The apples ... are
small, green, intensely acid, and very odoriferous. Some
farmers make cider of them, which is said to be excellent:
they make very fine sweet-meats also, by the addition
of a large quantity of sugar” (Michaux). Celebrated for
“the beauty of its flowers, and for the sweetness of its
perfume” (Michaux).<a name='FA_174' id='FA_174' href='#FN_174' class='fnanchor'>[174]</a>
</p>

<p>
Michaux says that the wild apple of Europe has
yielded to cultivation nearly three hundred species in
France alone. Emerson says, referring to Loudon,
“In 1836, the catalogue and the gardens of the London
Horticultural Society contained upwards of 1400
distinct sorts, and new ones are every year added.”
</p>

<p>
But here are species which they have not in their
catalogue, not to mention the varieties which the crab
might yield to cultivation.<a name='FA_175' id='FA_175' href='#FN_175' class='fnanchor'>[175]</a>
</p>

<p>
This genus, so kind to the human race, the <i>Malus</i>
or <i>Pyrus</i>; <i>Rosaceæ</i> the family, or others say <i>Pomaceæ</i>.
Its flowers are perhaps the most beautiful of any tree.
I am frequently compelled to turn and linger by some
more than usually beautiful two-thirds-expanded blossoms.<a name='FA_176' id='FA_176' href='#FN_176' class='fnanchor'>[176]</a>
If such were not so common, its fame would be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
loud as well as wide. Its most copious and delicious
blossoms.
</p>

<p>
But our wild apple is wild perchance like myself,
who belong not to the aboriginal race here, but have
strayed into the woods from the cultivated stock,<a name='FA_177' id='FA_177' href='#FN_177' class='fnanchor'>[177]</a>—where
the birds, where winged thoughts or agents, have
planted or are planting me. Even these at length furnish
hardy stocks for the orchard.
</p>

You might call one <i>Malus oculata</i>; another <i>M.

Distinctly related things are strangely near in <i>fact</i>,

years ago a garrison-house, with thick log walls, bullet-proof,

<i>May 24. Saturday.</i> Our most glorious experiences
are a kind of regret. Our regret is so sublime that we
may mistake it for triumph. It is the painful, plaintively
sad surprise of our Genius remembering our past lives
and contemplating what is possible. It is remarkable
that men commonly never refer to, never hint at, any
crowning experiences when the common laws of their
being were unsettled and the divine and eternal laws
prevailed in them. Their lives are not revolutionary;
they never recognize any other than the local and temporal
authorities. It is a regret so divine and inspiring,
so genuine, based on so true and distinct a contrast,
that it surpasses our proudest boasts and the fairest
expectations.
</p>

<p>
My most sacred and memorable life is commonly on
awaking in the morning. I frequently awake with an
atmosphere about me as if my unremembered dreams
had been divine, as if my spirit had journeyed to its
native place, and, in the act of reëntering its native
body, had diffused an elysian fragrance around.
</p>

<p>
The Genius says: “Ah! That is what you were!
That is what you may yet be!” It is glorious for us to
be able to regret even such an existence.
</p>

<p>
A sane and growing man revolutionizes every day.
What institutions of man can survive a morning experience?

A single night’s sleep, if we have indeed slumbered
and forgotten anything and grown in our sleep,
puts them behind us like the river Lethe. It is no

It is an interesting inquiry to seek for the medicines
which will cure our ails in the plants which grow around
us. At first we are not disposed to believe that man and
plants are so intimately related. Very few plants have
been medically examined. And yet this is the extent
of most men’s botany; and it is more extensive than
would at first be supposed. The botanist is startled by
some countryman’s familiarity with an obscure plant to
him rare and strange. He, who has been an observer for
some years, knows not what it is, but the unobserving
countryman, who sees nothing but what is thrust upon
him, or the old woman who rarely goes out of the house,
shows an easy familiarity with it and can call it by
name.
</p>

<p>
I am struck by the fact that, though any important
individual experience is rare, though it is so rare that
the individual is conscious of a relation to his maker
transcending time and space and earth, though any
knowledge of, or communication from, “Providence”
is the rarest thing in the world, yet men very easily,
regarding themselves in the gross, speak of carrying
out the designs of Providence as nations. How often
the Saxon man talks of carrying out the designs of
Providence, as if he had some knowledge of Providence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
and His designs. Men allow themselves to associate
Providence and designs of Providence with their dull,
prosaic, every-day thoughts of things. That language
is usurped by the stalest and deadest prose, which can
only report the most choice poetic experience. This
“Providence” is the stalest jest in the universe. The
office-boy sweeps out his office  “by the leave of Providence.”

<i>May 25.</i> A fine, freshening air, a little hazy, that
bathes and washes everything, saving the day from
extreme heat. Walked to the hills south of Wayland by
the road by Deacon Farrar’s. First vista just beyond
Merron’s (?), looking west down a valley, with a verdant-columned
elm at the extremity of the vale and the blue
hills and horizon beyond. These are the resting-places
in a walk. We love to see any part of the earth tinged
with blue, cerulean, the color of the sky, the celestial
color. I wonder that houses are not oftener located
mainly that they may command particular rare prospects,
every convenience yielding to this. The farmer
would never suspect what it was you were buying, and
such sites would be the cheapest of any. A site where
you might avail yourself of the art of Nature for three
thousand years, which could never be materially changed
or taken from you, a noble inheritance for your children.
The true sites for human dwellings are unimproved. They
command no price in the market. Men will pay something
to look into a travelling showman’s box, but not
to look upon the fairest prospects on the earth. A vista
where you have the near green horizon contrasted with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
the distant blue one, terrestrial with celestial earth.
The prospect of a vast horizon must be accessible in
our neighborhood. Where men of enlarged views may
be educated. An unchangeable kind of wealth, a <i>real</i>
estate.
</p>

<p>
There we found the celandine in blossom and the
<i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i>, which we afterwards saw <i>double</i>
in Wayland, having nine petals.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Pyrus arbutifolia</i>, variety <i>melanocarpa</i>. Gray
makes also the variety <i>erythrocarpa</i>. Is this the late red
choke-berry of the swamps? and is the former the earlier
black one of the swamps?
</p>

<p>
By Farrar’s the <i>Nepeta Glechoma</i>, a kind of mint.
Linnæus calls it <i>Glechoma hederacea</i>. Looks somewhat
like catnep.
</p>

<p>
The marsh-marigold, <i>Caltha palustris</i>, improperly
called cowslip.
</p>

<p>
The white oak, <i>Quercus alba</i>. And the commonest
scrub oak, the bear or black oak, <i>Q. ilicifolia</i>.

Another glorious vista with a wide horizon at the
yellow Dutch house, just over the Wayland line, by
the black spruce, heavy and dark as night, which we
could see two or three miles as a landmark. Now at
least, before the deciduous trees have fully expanded
their leaves, it is remarkably black. It is more stoutly
and irregularly branched than Holbrook’s spruces—has
a much darker foliage; but the cone scales of both
are slightly waved or notched. Are they, then, both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
black spruce? The cones are enough like, and the
thickness of the leaves; their color enough unlike. Here
is a view of the Jenkins house, the fish-pole house, and
Wachusett beyond.

<p>
Noticed what I think must be a young poison sumach<a name='FA_180' id='FA_180' href='#FN_180' class='fnanchor'>[180]</a>
abundant by the roadside in woods, with last year’s berries,
with small greenish-yellow flowers, but leaves not
pinnatifid, three together; from one to two feet high.
What is it?
</p>

<p>
<i>Alnus serrulata</i>, the common alder, with a grayish
stem, leaves smooth on both sides.
</p>

<p>
<i>Alnus incana</i>, the speckled alder, downy on under
side of leaves.
</p>

<p>
The hard-berried plant seems to be <i>Andromeda
ligustrina</i> (?) of Gray, <i>A. paniculata</i> of Bigelow,
<i>Lyonia paniculata</i> of Emerson.

Thyme-leaved veronica, little bluish-white, streak-petalled

Westward, or west by south, an island in a pond or in

the elm between Wayland and Weston which is seen so

far in the horizon from the northwest part of Sudbury.
A good, a rare place this must be to view the Sudbury
or Wayland meadows a little earlier.

life away. It is like the dreaming of frogs in a summer
evening.

<p class="p2">
<i>May 27.</i> I saw an organ-grinder this morning before
a rich man’s house, thrilling the street with harmony,
loosening the very paving-stones and tearing the routine
of life to rags and tatters, when the lady of the house
shoved up a window and in a semiphilanthropic tone
inquired if he wanted anything to eat. But he, very
properly it seemed to me, kept on grinding and paid
no attention to her question, feeding her ears with
melody unasked for. So the world shoves up its window
and interrogates the poet, and sets him to gauging ale
casks in return. It seemed to me that the music suggested
that the recompense should be as fine as the gift. It
would be much nobler to enjoy the music, though you
paid no money for it, than to presume always a beggarly
relation. It is after all, perhaps, the best instrumental
music that we have.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>May 28.</i> The trees now begin to shade the streets.
When the sun gets high in the sky the trees give shade.
With oppressive heats come refreshing shadows.
</p>

<p>
The buttercups spot the churchyard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>May 29.</i> It is evident that the virtues of plants are
almost completely unknown to us, and we esteem the
few with which we are better acquainted unreasonably
above the many which are comparatively unknown to
us. Bigelow says: “It is a subject of some curiosity
to consider, if the knowledge of the present Materia
Medica were by any means to be lost, how many of the
same articles would again rise into notice and use.
Doubtless a variety of new substances would develop
unexpected powers, while perhaps the poppy would
be shunned as a deleterious plant, and the cinchona
might grow unmolested upon the mountains of Quito.”
Sawyer regards <i>Nux vomica</i> among the most valuable.
B. says (1817): “We have yet to discover our anodynes
and our emetics, although we abound in bitters, astringents,
aromatics, and demulcents. In the present state
of our knowledge we could not well dispense with opium
and ipecacuanha, yet a great number of foreign drugs,
such as gentian, columbo, chamomile, kino, catechu,
cascarilla, canella, etc., for which we pay a large annual
tax to other countries, might in all probability
be superseded by the indigenous products of our own. It
is certainly better that our own country people should
have the benefit of collecting such articles, than that
we should pay for them to the Moors of Africa, or the
Indians of Brazil.”
</p>

<p>
The thorn-apple (<i>Datura Stramonium</i>) (apple of
Peru, devil’s-apple, Jamestown-weed) “emigrates with
great facility, and often springs up in the ballast of
ships, and in earth carried from one country to another.”
It secretes itself in the hold of vessels and migrates. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
is a sort of cosmopolitan weed, a roving weed. What
adventures! What historian knows when first it came
into a country! He quotes Beverly’s “History of Virginia”
as saying that some soldiers in the days of Bacon’s
rebellion, having eaten some of this plant, which
was boiled for salad by mistake, were made natural fools
and buffoons by it for eleven days, without injury to their
bodies (? ?).
</p>

<p>
The root of a biennial or perennial will accumulate
the virtues of the plant more than any other part.
</p>

<p>
B. says that Pursh states that the sweet-scented
goldenrod (<i>Solidago odora</i>) “has for some time [<i>i. e.</i>
before 1817]<a name='FA_185' id='FA_185' href='#FN_185' class='fnanchor'>[185]</a> been an article of exportation to China,
where it fetches a high price.” And yet it is known to
very few New-Englanders.
</p>

<p>
“No botanist,” says B., “even if in danger of starving
in a wilderness, would indulge his hunger on a root or
fruit taken from an unknown plant of the natural order
<i>Luridæ</i>, of the <i>Multisiliquæ</i>, or the <i>umbelliferous aquatics</i>.
On the contrary he would not feel a moment’s
hesitation in regard to any of the <i>Gramina</i>, the fruit
of the <i>Pomaceæ</i> and several other natural families of
plants, which are known to be uniformly innocent in
their effects.”
</p>

<p>
The aromatic flavor of the checkerberry is also perceived
in the <i>Gaultheria hispidula</i>, in <i>Spiræa ulmaria</i>
and the root of <i>Spiræa lobata</i>, and in the birches.
</p>

<p>
He says ginseng, spigelia, snake-root, etc., form
considerable articles of exportation.
</p>

<p>
The odor of skunk-cabbage is perceived in some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
North American currants, as <i>Ribes rigens</i> of Michaux
on high mountains.
</p>

<p>
At one time the Indians about Quebec and Montreal
were so taken up with searching for ginseng that they
could not be hired for any other purpose. It is said that
both the Chinese and the Indians named this plant
from its resemblance to the figure of a man.<a name='FA_186' id='FA_186' href='#FN_186' class='fnanchor'>[186]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Indians use the bark of <i>Dirca palustris</i>, or
leather-wood, for their cordage. It was after the long-continued
search of many generations that these qualities
were discovered.
</p>

<p>
Of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana Tabacum</i>) B. says, after
speaking of its poisonous qualities: “Yet the first
person who had courage and patience enough to persevere
in its use, until habit had overcome his original
disgust, eventually found in it a pleasing sedative, a
soother of care, and a material addition to the pleasures
of life. Its use, which originated among savages, has
spread into every civilized country; it has made its way
against the declamations of the learned, and the prohibitions
of civil and religious authority, and it now gives
rise to an extensive branch of agriculture, or of commerce,
in every part of the globe.” Soon after its introduction
into Europe, “the rich indulged in it as a
luxury of the highest kind; and the poor gave themselves
up to it, as a solace for the miseries of life.” Several
varieties are cultivated.
</p>

<p>
In return for many foreign weeds, we have sent abroad,
says B., “the <i>Erigeron Canadensis</i> and the prolific
families of <i>Ambrosia</i> and <i>Amaranthus</i>.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“The Indians were acquainted with the medicinal
properties of more than one species of Euphorbia.”
</p>

<p>
I noticed the button-bush, May 25th, around an
elevated pond or mud-hole, its leaves just beginning to
expand. This slight amount of green contrasted with
its dark, craggly [<i>sic</i>], naked-looking stem and branches—as
if subsiding waters had left them bare—looked
Dantesque and infernal. It is not a handsome bush at
this season, it is so slow to put out its leaves and hide
its naked and unsightly stems.

<br />
JUNE, 1851
<br />
(ÆT. 33)
</h2>

<p>
<i>June 3. Tuesday.</i> Lectured in Worcester last
Saturday, and walked to <i>As-</i> or <i>Has</i>nebumskit Hill in
Paxton the next day. Said to be the highest land in
Worcester County except Wachusett.
</p>

<p>
Met Mr. Blake, Brown, Chamberlin, Hinsdale, Miss
Butman (?), Wyman, Conant.
</p>

<p>
Returned to Boston yesterday. Conversed with John
Downes, who is connected with the Coast Survey, is
printing tables for astronomical, geodesic, and other
uses. He tells me that he once saw the common sucker
in numbers piling up stones as big as his fist (like the
piles which I have seen), taking them up or moving
them with their mouths.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Harris suggests that the mountain cranberry which
I saw at Ktaadn was the <i>Vaccinium Vitis-Idæa</i>, cow-berry,
because it was edible and not the <i>Uva-Ursi</i>, or
bear-berry, which we have in Concord.
</p>

<p>
Saw the <i>Uvularia perfoliata</i>, perfoliate bellwort, in
Worcester near the hill; an abundance of mountain
laurel on the hills, now budded to blossom and the
fresh lighter growth contrasting with the dark green; an
abundance of very large checkerberries, or partridge-berries,
as Bigelow calls them, on Hasnebumskit.
Sugar maples about there. A very extensive view, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
the western view not so much wilder as I expected.
See Barre, about fifteen miles off, and Rutland, etc., etc.
Not so much forest as in our neighborhood; high,
swelling hills, but less shade for the walker. The hills
are green, the soil springier; and it is written that
water is more easily obtained on the hill than in the
valleys. Saw a Scotch fir, the pine so valued for tar and
naval uses in the north of Europe.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chamberlin told me that there was no corporation
in Worcester except the banks (which I suspect
may not be literally true), and hence their freedom and
independence. I think it likely there is a gas company
to light the streets at least.
</p>

<p>
John Mactaggart finds the ice thickest not in the
largest lakes in Canada, nor in the smallest, where the
surrounding forests melt it. He says that the surveyor
of the boundary-line between England and United States
on the Columbia River saw pine trees which would
require sixteen feet in the blade to a cross-cut saw to
do anything with them.
</p>

<p>
I examined to-day a large swamp white oak in Hubbard’s
meadow, which was blown down by the same
storm which destroyed the lighthouse. At five feet from
the ground it was nine and three fourths feet in circumference;
the first branch at eleven and a half feet from
ground; and it held its size up to twenty-three feet from
the ground. Its whole height, measured on the ground,
was eighty feet, and its breadth about sixty-six feet. The
roots on one side were turned up with the soil on them,
making an object very conspicuous a great distance off,
the highest root being eighteen feet from the ground
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
and fourteen feet above centre of trunk. The roots,
which were small and thickly interlaced, were from
three to nine inches beneath the surface (in other trees
I saw them level with the surface) and thence extended
fifteen to eighteen inches in depth (<i>i. e.</i> to this depth
they occupied the ground). They were broken off at
about eleven feet from the centre of the trunk and were
there on an average one inch in diameter, the largest
being three inches in diameter. The longest root was
broken off at twenty feet from the centre, and was there
three quarters of an inch in diameter. The tree was rotten
within. The lower side of the soil (what was originally
the lower), which clothed the roots for nine feet
from the centre of the tree, was white and clayey to
appearance, and a sparrow was sitting on three eggs
within the mass. Directly under where the massive
trunk had stood, and within a foot of the surface, you
could apparently strike in a spade and meet with no
obstruction to a free cultivation. There was no taproot
to be seen. The roots were encircled with dark,
nubby rings. The tree, which still had a portion of its
roots in the ground and held to them by a sliver on the
leeward side, was alive and had leaved
out, though on many branches the leaves
were shrivelled again. <i>Quercus bicolor</i> of
Bigelow, <i>Q. Prinus discolor</i> Mx. f.

<img src="images/i-261.jpg" width="111" height="127" alt="Grass" />
</div>

<p>
I observed the grass waving to-day for
the first time,—the swift Camilla on it. It
might have been noticed before. You might have seen
it now for a week past on grain-fields.
</p>

<p>
Clover has blossomed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I noticed the indigo-weed a week or two ago pushing
up like asparagus. Methinks it must be the small andromeda (?),
that dull red mass of leaves in the swamp,
mixed perchance with the rhodora, with its dry fruitlike
appendages, as well as the <i>Andromeda paniculata</i>,
else called <i>ligustrina</i>, and the clethra. It was the golden
senecio (<i>Senecio aureus</i>) which I plucked a week ago
in a meadow in Wayland. The earliest, methinks, of
the aster and autumnal-looking yellow flowers. Its
bruised stems enchanted me with their indescribable
sweet odor, like I cannot think what.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> includes several kinds of
bush beans, of which those I raised were one.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 6. Friday.</i> Gathered last night the strong,
rank, penetrating-scented angelica.
</p>

<p>
Under the head of the <i>Cicuta maculata</i>, or American
hemlock,—“It is a rule sanctioned by the observations
of medical botanists, that umbelliferous plants,
which grow in or about the water, are of a poisonous
nature.”<a name='FA_191' id='FA_191' href='#FN_191' class='fnanchor'>[191]</a> He does not say that the angelica is poisonous,
but I suppose that it is. It has such a rank, offensive,
and killing odor as makes me think of the ingredients
of the witches’ cauldron. It did not leave my
hands, which had carried it, long after I had washed
them. A strong, penetrating, lasting, and sickening
odor.
</p>

<p>
Gathered to-night the <i>Cicuta maculata</i>, American
hemlock, the veins of the leaflets ending in the notches
and the root fasciculated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Bigelow says, “The leaves of the <i>Solidago odora</i> have
a delightfully fragrant odor, partaking of that of anise
and sassafras, but different from either.”<a name='FA_192' id='FA_192' href='#FN_192' class='fnanchor'>[192]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 7.</i> My practicalness is not to be trusted to the
last. To be sure, I go upon my legs for the most part,
but, being hard-pushed and dogged by a superficial
common sense which is bound to near objects by beaten
paths, I am off the handle, as the phrase is,—I begin
to be transcendental and show where my heart is. I
am like those guinea-fowl which Charles Darwin saw
at the Cape de Verd Islands. He says, “They avoided
us like partridges on a rainy day in September, running
with their heads cocked up; and if pursued, they readily
took to the wing.” Keep your distance, do not infringe
on the interval between us, and I will pick up lime and
lay real terrestrial eggs for you, and let you know by
cackling when I have done it.
</p>

<p>
When I have been asked to speak at a temperance
meeting, my answer has been, “I am too transcendental
to serve you in your way.” They would fain confine me
to the rum-sellers and rum-drinkers, of whom I am not
one, and whom I know little about.
</p>

<p>
It is a certain faeryland where we live. You may walk
out in any direction over the earth’s surface, lifting your
horizon, and everywhere your path, climbing the convexity
of the globe, leads you between heaven and earth,
not away from the light of the sun and stars and the
habitations of men. I wonder that I ever get five miles
on my way, the walk is so crowded with events and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
phenomena. How many questions there are which I
have not put to the inhabitants!
</p>

<p>
But how far can you carry <i>your</i> practicalness? How
far does your knowledge really extend? When I have
read in deeds only a hundred years old the words “to
enjoy and possess, he and his assigns, <i>forever</i>,” I have
seen how short-sighted is the sense which conducts from
day to day. When I read the epitaphs of those who
died a century ago, they seem deader even than they
expected. A day seems proportionally a long part of
your “forever and a day.”
</p>

<p>
There are few so temperate and chaste that they can
afford to remind us even at table that they have a palate
and a stomach.
</p>

<p>
We believe that the possibility of the future far exceeds
the accomplishment of the past. We review the
past with the common sense, but we anticipate the
future with transcendental senses. In our sanest moments
we find ourselves naturally expecting or prepared
for far greater changes than any which we have
experienced within the period of distinct memory, only
to be paralleled by experiences which are forgotten.
Perchance there are revolutions which create an interval
impassable to the memory.
</p>

<p>
With reference to the near past, we all occupy the region
of common sense, but in the prospect of the future
we are, by instinct, transcendentalists.
</p>

<p>
We affirm that all things are possible, but only these
things have been to our knowledge. I do not even infer
the future <i>from what I know of the past</i>. I am hardly
better acquainted with the past than with the future.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
What is new to the individual may be familiar to the
experience of his race. It must be rare indeed that the
experience of the individual transcends that of his race.
It will be perceived that there are two kinds of change,—that
of the race, and that of the individual within
the limits of the former.
</p>

<p class="p2">
One of those gentle, straight-down rainy days, when
the rain begins by spotting the cultivated fields as if
shaken from a pepper-box; a fishing day, when I see
one neighbor after another, having donned his oil-cloth
suit, walking or riding past with a fish-pole, having
struck work,—a day and an employment to make
philosophers of them all.
</p>

<p class="p2">
When introduced to high life I cannot help perceiving
how it is as a thing jumped at, and I find that I do not
get on in my enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it,
because my attention is wholly occupied with the jump,
remembering that the greatest genuine leap on record,
due to human muscles alone, is that of certain wandering
Arabs who cleared twenty-five feet on level ground.
The first question which I am tempted to put to the
proprietor of such great impropriety is, “Who boosts
you?” Are you one of the ninety-nine who fail or the
hundredth, who succeeds?

<i>June 8. Sunday.</i> In F. A. Michaux’s, <i>i. e.</i> the younger
Michaux’s, “<span lang="fr_FR">Voyage à l’ouest des Monts Alléghanys</span>,
1802,” printed at Paris, 1808:—

He says the common inquiry in the newly settled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
West was, “‘From what part of the world have you

The current of the Ohio is so swift in the spring that
it is not necessary to row. Indeed rowing would do
more harm than good, since it would tend to turn the
ark out of the current on to some isle or sand-bar, where
it would be entangled amid floating trees. This has
determined the form of the bateaux, which are not the
best calculated for swiftness but to obey the current.
They are from fifteen to fifty feet long by ten to twelve
and fifteen, with square ends, and roof of boards like a
house at one end. The sides are about four and a half
feet above the water. “I was alone on the shore of the
Monongahela, when I perceived, for the first time, in
the distance, five or six of these bateaux which were
descending this river. I could not conceive what those
great square boxes were, which, abandoned to the
current, presented alternately their ends, their sides,
and even (or also (?), <i>et même</i>) their angles. As they
came nearer, I heard a confused noise but without
distinguishing anything, on account of the elevation
of the sides. It was only on ascending the bank of the
river that I perceived, in these bateaux, many families
carrying with them their horses, cows, poultry,
dismounted carts (<i>charrettes</i>), plows, harnesses, beds,
agricultural implements, in short all that constitute the
movables of a household (<i>ménage</i>) and the carrying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
on (<i>exploitation</i>) of a farm.” But he was obliged to
paddle his log canoe “<i><span lang="fr_FR">sans cesse</span></i>” because of the sluggishness
of the current of the Ohio in April, 1802.
</p>

<p>
A Vermonter told him that the expense of clearing
land in his State was always defrayed by the potash
obtained from the ashes of the trees which were burnt,
and sometimes people took land to clear on condition
that they should have what potash they could make.

After travelling more than three thousand miles in
North America, he says that no part is to be compared
for the “<i><span lang="fr_FR">force végétative des forêts</span></i>” to the region of the
Ohio between Wheeling and Marietta. Thirty-six
miles above the last place he measured a plane tree on
the bank of the Ohio which, at four feet from the ground,
was forty-seven in circumference. It is true it was
“<i><span lang="fr_FR">renflé d’une manière prodigieuse</span></i>.” Tulip and plane
trees, his father had said, attained the greatest diameter
of North American trees.
</p>

<p>
Ginseng was then the only “territorial” production of
Kentucky which would pay the expense of transportation
<i>by land</i> to Philadelphia. They collected it from
spring to the first frosts. Even hunters carried for this
purpose, beside their guns, a bag and a little “<i>pioche</i>.”
From twenty-five to thirty “<i><span lang="fr_FR">milliers pesant</span></i>” were then
transported annually, and this commerce was on the
increase. Some transported it themselves from Kentucky
to China, <i>i. e.</i> without selling it [to] the merchants
of the seaboard. Traders in Kentucky gave twenty to
twenty-four “sous” the pound for it.

They habituated their wild hogs to return to the
house from time to time by distributing corn for them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
once or twice a week. So I read that in Buenos Ayres
they collect the horses into the corral twice a week to
keep them tame in a degree.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Gathered the first strawberries to-day.
</p>

<p>
Observed on Fair Haven a tall pitch pine, such as
some call yellow pine,—very smooth, yellowish, and
destitute of branches to a great height. The outer and
darker-colored bark appeared to have scaled off, leaving
a fresh and smooth surface. At the ground, all round
the tree, I saw what appeared to be the edges of the old
surface scales, extending to two inches more in thickness.
The bark was divided into large, smooth plates,
one to two feet long and four to six inches wide.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the cellular portion of the bark of the
canoe birch log from which I stripped the epidermis a
week or two ago was turned a complete brick-red color
very striking to behold and reminding me of the red
man and all strong, natural things,—the color of our
blood somewhat. Under the epidermis it was still a sort
of buff. The different colors of the various parts of this
bark, at various times, fresh or stale, are extremely
agreeable to my eye.
</p>

<p>
I found the white-pine-top full of staminate blossom-buds
not yet fully grown or expanded, with a rich red
tint like a tree full of fruit, but I could find no pistillate
blossom.
</p>

<p>
The fugacious-petalled cistus, and the pink, and the
lupines of various tints are seen together.
</p>

<p>
Our outside garments, which are often thin and
fanciful and merely for show, are our epidermis, hanging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
loose and fantastic like that of the yellow birch,
which may be cast off without harm, stripped off here
and there without fatal injury; sometimes called cuticle
and false skin. The vital principle wholly wanting in it;
partakes not of the life of the plant. Our thicker and more
essential garments are our cellular integument. When
this is removed, the tree is said to be girdled and dies.
Our shirt is the cortex, liber, or true bark, beneath which
is found the alburnum or sap-wood, while the heart in
old stocks is commonly rotten or has disappeared. As
if we grew like trees, and were of the exogenous kind.

<i>June 9.</i> James Wood, Senior, told me to-day that
Asa (?) Melvin’s father told him that he had seen alewives
caught (many of them) in the meadow which we
were crossing, on the west of Bateman’s Pond, where
now there is no stream, and though it is wet you can
walk everywhere; also one shad. He thinks that a
great part of the meadow once belonged to the pond.
</p>

<p>
Gathered the <i>Linnæa borealis</i>.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 11. Wednesday.</i> Last night a beautiful summer
night, not too warm, moon not quite full, after two
or three rainy days. Walked to Fair Haven by railroad,
returning by Potter’s pasture and Sudbury road. I
feared at first that there would be too much white light,
like the pale remains of daylight, and not a yellow,
gloomy, dreamier light; that it would be like a candlelight
by day; but when I got away from the town and
deeper into the night, it was better. I hear whip-poor-wills,
and see a few fireflies in the meadow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I saw by the shadows cast by the inequalities of the
clayey sand-bank in the Deep Cut that it was necessary
to see objects by moonlight as well as sunlight, to get a
complete notion of them. This bank had looked much
more flat by day, when the light was stronger, but now
the heavy shadows revealed its prominences. The prominences
are light, made more remarkable by the dark
shadows which they cast.
</p>

<p>
When I rose out of the Deep Cut into the old pigeon-place
field, I rose into a warmer stratum of air, it being
lighter. It told of the day, of sunny noontide hours,—an
air in which work had been done, which men had
breathed. It still remembered the sunny banks,—of
the laborer wiping his brow, of the bee humming amid
flowers, the hum of insects. Here is a puff of warmer
air which has taken its station on the hills; which has
come up from the sultry plains of noon.<a name='FA_194' id='FA_194' href='#FN_194' class='fnanchor'>[194]</a>
</p>

<p>
I hear the nighthawks uttering their squeaking notes
high in the air now at nine o’clock <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, and occasionally—what
I do not remember to have heard so late—their
booming note. It sounds more as if under a cope
than by day. The sound is not so fugacious, going off
to be lost amid the spheres, but is echoed hollowly to
earth, making the low roof of heaven vibrate. Such a
sound is more confused and dissipated by day.
</p>

<p>
The whip-poor-will suggests how wide asunder [are]
the woods and the town. Its note is very rarely heard
by those who live on the street, and then it is thought
to be of ill omen. Only the dwellers on the outskirts of
the village hear it occasionally. It sometimes comes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
into their yards. But go into the woods in a warm night
at this season, and it is the prevailing sound. I hear now
five or six at once. It is no more of ill omen therefore
here than the night and the moonlight are. It is a bird
not only of the woods, but of the night side of the
woods.
</p>

<p>
New beings have usurped the air we breathe, rounding
Nature, filling her crevices with sound. To sleep
where you may hear the whip-poor-will in your dreams!
</p>

<p>
I hear from this upland, from which I see Wachusett
by day, a wagon crossing one of the bridges. I have no
doubt that in some places to-night I should be sure
to hear every carriage which crossed a bridge over the
river within the limits of Concord, for in such an hour
and atmosphere the sense of hearing is wonderfully
assisted and asserts a new dignity, and [we] become the
Hearalls of the story. The late traveller cannot drive
his horse across the distant bridge, but this still and
resonant atmosphere tells the tale to my ear. Circumstances
are very favorable to the transmission of such a
sound. In the first place, planks so placed and struck
like a bell swung near the earth emit a very resonant
and penetrating sound; add that the bell is, in this
instance, hung over water, and that the night air, not
only on account of its stillness, but perhaps on account
of its density, is more favorable to the transmission of
sound. If the whole town were a raised planked floor,
what a din there would be!
</p>

<p>
I hear some whip-poor-wills on hills, others in thick
wooded vales, which ring hollow and cavernous, like an
apartment or cellar, with their note. As when I hear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
the working of some artisan from within an apartment.
</p>

<p>
I now descend round the corner of the grain-field,
through the pitch pine wood into a lower field, more
inclosed by woods, and find myself in a colder, damp
and misty atmosphere, with much dew on the grass.
I seem to be nearer to the origin of things. There is
something creative and primal in the cool mist. This
dewy mist does not fail to suggest music to me, unaccountably;
fertility, the origin of things. An atmosphere
which has forgotten the sun, where the ancient principle
of moisture prevails. It is laden with the condensed
fragrance of plants and, as it were, distilled in
dews.
</p>

<p>
The woodland paths are never seen to such advantage
as in a moonlight night, so embowered, still opening
before you almost against expectation as you walk; you
are so completely in the woods, and yet your feet meet
no obstacles. It is as if it were not a path, but an open,
winding passage through the bushes, which your feet
find.
</p>

<p>
Now I go by the spring, and when I have risen to the
same level as before, find myself in the warm stratum
again.
</p>

<p>
The woods are about as destitute of inhabitants at
night as the streets. In both there will be some night-walkers.
There are but few wild creatures to seek their
prey. The greater part of its inhabitants have retired
to rest.
</p>

<p>
Ah, that life that I have known! How hard it is to
remember what is most memorable! We remember
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
how we itched, not how our hearts beat. I can sometimes
recall to mind the quality, the immortality, of my
youthful life, but in memory is the only relation to it.
</p>

<p>
The very cows have now left their pastures and are
driven home to their yards. I meet no creature in the
fields.
</p>

<p>
I hear the night-warbler<a name='FA_195' id='FA_195' href='#FN_195' class='fnanchor'>[195]</a> breaking out as in his
dreams, made so from the first for some mysterious
reason.
</p>

<p>
Our spiritual side takes a more distinct form, like our
shadow which we see accompanying us.
</p>

<p>
I do not know but I feel less vigor at night; my legs
will not carry me so far; as if the night were less favorable
to muscular exertion,—weakened us, somewhat
as darkness turns plants pale. But perhaps my experience
is to be referred to being already exhausted by the
day, and I have never tried the experiment fairly. Yet
sometimes after a hard day’s work I have found myself
unexpectedly vigorous. It was so hot summer before
last that the Irish laborers on the railroad worked by
night instead of day for a while, several of them having
been killed by the heat and cold water. I do not
know but they did as much work as ever by day. Yet
methinks Nature would not smile on such labors.
</p>

<p>
Only the Hunter’s and Harvest moons are famous,
but I think that each full moon deserves to be and has
its own character well marked. One might be called
the Midsummer-Night Moon.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The wind and water are still awake. At night you
are sure to hear what wind there is stirring. The wind
blows, the river flows, without resting. There lies Fair
Haven Lake, undistinguishable from fallen sky. The
pines seem forever foreign, at least to the civilized man,—not
only their aspect but their scent, and their turpentine.
</p>

<p>
So still and moderate is the night! No scream is
heard, whether of fear or joy. No great comedy nor
tragedy is being enacted. The chirping of crickets is
the most universal, if not the loudest, sound. There
is no French Revolution in Nature, no excess. She is
warmer or colder by a degree or two.
</p>

<p>
By night no flowers, at least no variety of colors. The
pinks are no longer pink; they only shine faintly, reflecting
more light. Instead of flowers underfoot, stars
overhead.
</p>

<p>
My shadow has the distinctness of a second person,
a certain black companion bordering on the imp, and
I ask, “Who is this?” which I see dodging behind me
as I am about to sit down on a rock.
</p>

<p>
No one, to my knowledge, has observed the minute
differences in the seasons. Hardly two nights are alike.
The rocks do not feel warm to-night, for the air is
warmest; nor does the sand particularly. A book of
the seasons, each page of which should be written in
its own season and out-of-doors, or in its own locality
wherever it may be.
</p>

<p>
When you get into the road, though far from the
town, and feel the sand under your feet, it is as if you
had reached your own gravel walk. You no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
hear the whip-poor-will, nor regard your shadow, for
here you expect a fellow-traveller. You catch yourself
walking merely. The road leads your steps and thoughts
alike to the town. You see only the path, and your
thoughts wander from the objects which are presented
to your senses. You are no longer in place. It is like
conformity,—walking in the ways of men.

In Charles Darwin’s “Voyage of a Naturalist round
the World,” commenced in 1831:—
</p>

<p>
He gave to Ehrenberg some of an impalpably fine
dust which filled the air at sea near the Cape de Verd
Islands, and he found it to consist in great part of
“infusoria with siliceous shields, and of the siliceous
tissue of plants;” found in this sixty-seven different
organic forms. The infusoria with two exceptions inhabitants
of fresh water. Vessels have even run on
shore owing to the obscurity. Is seen a thousand miles
from Africa. Darwin found particles of stone above a
thousandth of an inch square.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of St. Paul’s Rocks, Lat. 58´ N., Long. 29°
15´ W., “Not a single plant, not even a lichen, grows
on this islet; yet it is inhabited by several insects and
spiders. The following list completes, I believe, the
terrestrial fauna: a fly (Olfersia) living on the booby,
and a tick which must have come here as a parasite on
the birds; a small brown moth, belonging to a genus
that feeds on feathers; a beetle (Quedius), and a woodlouse
from beneath the dung; and lastly numerous
spiders, which I suppose prey on these small attendants
and scavengers of the waterfowl. The often-repeated
description of the stately palm and other noble tropical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
plants, then birds, and lastly man, taking possession
of the coral islets as soon as formed, in the Pacific, is
probably not quite correct; I fear it destroys the poetry
of this story, that feather and dirt-feeding and parasitic
insects and spiders should be the first inhabitants
of newly-formed oceanic land.”

Of a partridge near the mouth of the Plata, “A man
on horseback, by riding round and round in a circle,
or rather in a spire, so as to approach closer each time,
may knock on the head as many as he pleases.” Refers
to Hearne’s Journey, page 383, for “In Arctic North
America the Indians catch the Varying Hare by walking
spirally round and round it, when on its form: the
middle of the day is reckoned the best time, when the
sun is high, and the shadow of the hunter not very long.”
</p>

<p>
In the same place, “General Rosas is also a perfect
horseman—an accomplishment of no small consequence
in a country where an assembled army elected
its general by the following trial: A troop of unbroken
horses being driven into a corral, were let out through
a gateway, above which was a cross-bar: it was agreed
whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild
animals, as it rushed out, and should be able, without
saddle or bridle, not only to ride it, but also to bring
it back to the door of the corral, should be their general.
The person who succeeded was accordingly elected, and
doubtless made a general fit for such an army. This
extraordinary feat has also been performed by Rosas.”

Hail in Buenos Ayres as large as small apples; killed

ten inches in circumference; passed through windows,
making round holes.

A difference in the country about Montevideo and
somewhere else attributed to the manuring and grazing
of the cattle. Refers to Atwater as saying that the same
thing is observed in the prairies of North America,
“where coarse grass, between five and six feet high,
when grazed by cattle, changes into common pasture
land.” (<i>Vide</i> Atwater’s words in Silliman’s <i>North

Speaks<a name='FA_196' id='FA_196' href='#FN_196' class='fnanchor'>[196]</a> of the fennel and the cardoon (<i>Cynara
cardunculus</i>), introduced from Europe, now very common
in those parts of South America. The latter occurs
now on both sides the Cordilleras across the continent.
In Banda Oriental alone “very many (probably several
hundred) square miles are covered by one mass of these
prickly plants, and are impenetrable by man or beast.
Over the undulating plains, where these great beds
occur, nothing else can now live.... I doubt whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
any case is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale
of one plant over the aborigines.”
</p>

<p>
Horses first landed at the La Plata in 1535. Now
these, with cattle and sheep, have altered the whole
aspect of the country,—vegetation, etc. “The wild pig
in some parts probably replaces the peccari; packs of
wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks
of the less frequented streams; and the common cat,
altered into a large and fierce animal, inhabits rocky
hills.”
</p>

<p>
At sea, eye being six feet above level, horizon is
two and four fifths miles distant. “In like manner, the
more level the plain, the more nearly does the horizon
approach within these narrow limits; and this, in
my opinion, entirely destroys that grandeur which one
would have imagined that a vast level plain would have
possessed.”

Darwin found a tooth of a <i>native horse</i> contemporary
with the mastodon, on the Pampas of Buenos Ayres,
though he says there is good evidence against any horse
living in America at the time of Columbus. He speaks
of their remains being common in North America.
Owen has found Darwin’s tooth similar to one Lyell
brought from the United States, but unlike any other,
fossil or living, and named this American horse <i>Equus
curvidens</i>, from a slight but peculiar curvature in it.

Africa in a time of great drought, a number of elephants
entered in a body to possess themselves of the wells.
After a desperate conflict and the loss of one man, the
inhabitants—three thousand—drove them off. During
a great drought in India, says Dr. Malcomson, “a
hare drank out of a vessel held by the adjutant of the
regiment.”

The only quadruped native to the Falkland Islands
is a large wolf-like fox. As far as he is aware, “there is
no other instance in any part of the world of so small
a mass of broken land, distant from a continent, possessing
so large an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to
itself.”
</p>

<p>
In the Falkland Isles, where other fuel is scarce, they
frequently cook their beef with the bones from which
the meat has been scraped. Also they have “a green
little bush about the size of common heath, which has
the useful property of burning while fresh and green.”

Some inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego having got some
putrid whale’s blubber in time of famine, “an old man
cut off thin slices and muttering over them, broiled them
for a minute, and distributed them to the famished
party, who during this time preserved a profound silence.”
This was the only evidence of any religious
worship among them. It suggests that even the animals
may have something divine in them and akin to revelation,—some
inspirations allying them to man as to
God.

“Nor is it easy to teach them our superiority except
by striking a fatal blow. Like wild beasts, they do not
appear to compare numbers; for each individual, if
attacked, instead of retiring, will endeavor to dash your
brains out with a stone, as certainly as a tiger under
similar circumstances would tear you.”

Ehrenberg examined some of the white paint with
which the Fuegians daub themselves, and found it to be
composed of infusoria, including fourteen polygastrica,
and four phytolitharia, inhabitants of fresh water, all
old and known forms!!
</p>

<p>
Again of the Fuegians: “Simple circumstances—such
as the beauty of scarlet cloth or blue beads, the
absence of women, our care in washing ourselves—excited
their admiration far more than any grand or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>

some of these stones were so heavy that, when drawn
to the surface, they could scarcely be lifted into a boat
by one person.” Captain Cook thought that some of
it grew to the length of three hundred and sixty feet.
“The beds of this sea-weed, even when not of great
breadth,” says D., “make excellent natural floating
breakwaters. It is quite curious to see, in an exposed

harbor, how soon the waves from the open sea, as
they travel through the straggling stems, sink in height,
and pass into smooth water.”

In an excursion from Valparaiso to the base of the

and prepared to pass the night. The evening was fine,
and the atmosphere so clear that the masts of the vessels
at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso, although no
less than twenty-six geographical miles distant, could
be distinguished clearly as little black streaks.” Anson

<i>June 13.</i> Walked to Walden last night (moon not
quite full) by railroad and upland wood-path, returning
by Wayland road. Last full moon the elms had not
leaved out,—cast no heavy shadows,—and their outlines
were less striking and rich in the streets at night.
</p>

<p>
I noticed night before night before last from Fair
Haven how valuable was some water by moonlight,
like the river and Fair Haven Pond, though far away,
reflecting the light with a faint glimmering sheen, as in
the spring of the year. The water shines with an inward
light like a heaven on earth. The silent depth and serenity
and majesty of water! Strange that men should
distinguish gold and diamonds, when these precious
elements are so common. I saw a distant river by
moonlight, making no noise, yet flowing, as by day,
still to the sea, like melted silver reflecting the moonlight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
Far away it lay encircling the earth. How far away
it may look in the night, and even from a low hill how
miles away down in the valley! As far off as paradise
and the delectable country! There is a certain glory
attends on water by night. By it the heavens are related
to the earth, undistinguishable from a sky beneath
you. And I forgot to say that after I reached the road
by Potter’s bars,—or further, by Potter’s Brook,—I
saw the moon suddenly reflected full from a pool. A
puddle from which you may see the moon reflected,
and the earth dissolved under your feet. The magical
moon with attendant stars suddenly looking up with
mild lustre from a window in the dark earth.
</p>

<p>
I observed also the same night a halo about my
shadow in the moonlight, which I referred to the accidentally
lighter color of the surrounding surface; I
transferred my shadow to the darkest patches of grass,
and saw the halo there equally. It serves to make the
outlines of the shadow more distinct.
</p>

<p>
But now for last night. A few fireflies in the meadow.
Do they shine, though invisibly, by day? Is their candle
lighted by day? It is not nightfall till the whip-poor-wills
begin to sing.
</p>

<p>
As I entered the Deep Cut, I was affected by beholding
the first faint reflection of genuine and unmixed
moonlight on the eastern sand-bank while the horizon,
yet red with day, was tingeing the western side. What
an interval between those two lights! The light of the
moon,—in what age of the world does that fall upon
the earth? The moonlight was as the earliest and dewy
morning light, and the daylight tinge reminded me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
much more of the night. There were the old and new
dynasties opposed, contrasted, and an interval between,
which time could not span. Then is night, when the daylight
yields to the nightlight. It suggested an interval,
a distance not recognized in history. Nations have
flourished in that light.
</p>

<p>
When I had climbed the sand-bank on the left, I felt
the warmer current or stratum of air on my cheek,
like a blast from a furnace.
</p>

<p>
The white stems of the pines, which reflected the
weak light, standing thick and close together while their
lower branches were gone, reminded me that the pines
are only larger grasses which rise to a chaffy head, and
we the insects that crawl between them. They are
particularly grass-like.
</p>

<p>
How long do the gales retain the heat of the sun? I
find them retreated high up the sides of hills, especially
on open fields or cleared places. Does, perchance, any
of this pregnant air survive the dews of night? Can
any of it be found remembering the sun of yesterday
even in the morning hours. Does, perchance, some puff,
some blast, survive the night on elevated clearings
surrounded by the forest?

The bullfrog belongs to summer. The different

may be heard at last occasionally together.

I heard partridges drumming to-night as late as 9
o’clock. What singularly space penetrating and filling
sound! Why am I never nearer to its source?

We do not commonly live our life out and full; we
do not fill all our pores with our blood; we do not
inspire and expire fully and entirely enough, so that
the wave, the comber, of each inspiration shall break
upon our extremest shores, rolling till it meets the sand
which bounds us, and the sound of the surf come back to
us. Might not a bellows assist us to breathe? That our
breathing should create a wind in a calm day! We live
but a fraction of our life. Why do we not let on the
flood, raise the gates, and set all our wheels in motion?
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Employ your
senses.

The newspapers tell us of news not to be named
even with that in its own kind which an observing man
can pick up in a solitary walk, as if it gained some
importance and dignity by its publicness. Do we need

of life?<a name='FA_202' id='FA_202' href='#FN_202' class='fnanchor'>[202]</a>

The tree-toad’s, too, is a summer sound.
</p>

<p>
I hear, just as the night sets in, faint notes from
time to time from some sparrow (?) falling asleep,—a
vesper hymn,—and later, in the woods, the chuckling,
rattling sound of some unseen bird on the near trees.
The nighthawk booms wide awake.

By moonlight we see not distinctly even the surface of

<p>
As I approached the pond down Hubbard’s Path,
after coming out of the woods into a warmer air, I saw
the shimmering of the moon on its surface, and, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
near, now flooded cove, the water-bugs, darting, circling
about, made streaks or curves of light. The moon’s
inverted pyramid of shimmering light commenced
about twenty rods off, like so much micaceous sand. But
I was startled to see midway in the dark water a bright
flamelike, more than phosphorescent light crowning
the crests of the wavelets, which at first I mistook for
fireflies, and thought even of cucullos.<a name='FA_203' id='FA_203' href='#FN_203' class='fnanchor'>[203]</a> It had the
appearance of a pure, smokeless flame a half-dozen
inches long, issuing from the water and bending flickeringly
along its surface. I thought of St. Elmo’s lights
and the like. But, coming near to the shore of the pond
itself, these flames increased, and I saw that even this
was so many broken reflections of the moon’s disk,
though one would have said they were of an intenser
light than the moon herself; from contrast with the
surrounding water they were. Standing up close to the
shore and nearer the rippled surface, I saw the reflections
of the moon sliding down the watery concave like
so many lustrous burnished coins poured from a bag
with inexhaustible lavishness, and the lambent flames
on the surface were much multiplied, seeming to slide
along a few inches with each wave before they were
extinguished; and I saw how farther and farther off they
gradually merged in the general sheen, which, in fact,
was made up of a myriad little mirrors reflecting the
disk of the moon with equal brightness to an eye rightly
placed. The pyramid or sheaf of light which we see
springing from near where we stand only, in fact, is the
outline of that portion of the shimmering surface which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
an eye takes in. To myriad eyes suitably placed, the
whole surface of the pond would be seen to shimmer,
or rather it would be seen, as the waves turned up their
mirrors, to be covered with those bright flame-like reflections
of the moon’s disk, like a myriad candles everywhere
issuing from the waves; <i>i. e.</i> if there were as many
eyes as angles presented by the waves, the whole surface
would appear as bright as the moon; and these reflections
are dispersed in all directions into the atmosphere,
flooding it with light. No wonder that water reveals
itself so far by night; even further in many states of
the atmosphere than by day. I thought at first it [was]
some unusual phosphorescence. In some positions these
flames were star-like points, brighter than the brightest
stars. Suddenly a flame would show itself in a near and
dark space, precisely like some inflammable gas on the
surface,—as if an inflammable gas made its way up
from the bottom.
</p>

<p>
I heard my old musical, simple-noted owl. The sound
of the <i>dreaming</i> frogs<a name='FA_204' id='FA_204' href='#FN_204' class='fnanchor'>[204]</a> prevails over the others. Occasionally
a bullfrog near me made an obscene noise, a
sound like an eructation, near me. I think they must be
imbodied eructations. They suggest flatulency.
</p>

<p>
The pond is higher than ever, so as to hinder fishermen,
and I could hardly get to the true shore here on
account of the bushes. I pushed out in a boat a little
and heard the chopping of the waves under its bow.
And on the bottom I saw the moving reflections of
the shining waves, faint streaks of light revealing the
shadows of the waves or the opaqueness of the water.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As I climbed the hill again toward my old bean-field, I
listened to the ancient, familiar, immortal, dear cricket
sound under all others, hearing at first some distinct
chirps; but when these ceased I was aware of the general
earth-song, which my hearing had not heard, amid
which these were only taller flowers in a bed, and I
wondered if behind or beneath this there was not some
other chant yet more universal. Why do we not hear
when this begins in the spring? and when it ceases in the
fall? Or is it too gradual?
</p>

<p>
After I have got into the road I have no thought to
record all the way home,—the walk is comparatively
barren. The leafy elm sprays seem to droop more by
night (??).
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 14. Saturday.</i> Full moon last night. Set out on
a walk to Conantum at 7 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> A serene evening, the
sun going down behind clouds, a few white or slightly
shaded piles of clouds floating in the eastern sky, but a
broad, clear, mellow cope left for the moon to rise into.
An evening for poets to describe. Met a man driving
home his cow from pasture and stopping to chat with
his neighbor; then a boy, who had set down his pail
in the road to stone a bird most perseveringly, whom I
heard afterward behind me telling his pail to be quiet
in a tone of assumed anger, because it squeaked under
his arm. As I proceed along the back road I hear the
lark still singing in the meadow, and the bobolink, and
the gold robin on the elms, and the swallows twittering
about the barns. A small bird chasing a crow high in
the air, who is going home at night. All nature is in an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
expectant attitude. Before Goodwin’s house, at the
opening of the Sudbury road, the swallows are diving
at a tortoise-shell cat, who curvets and frisks rather
awkwardly, as if she did not know whether to be scared
or not. And now, having proceeded a little way down
this road, the sun having buried himself in the low cloud
in the west and hung out his crimson curtains,<a name='FA_205' id='FA_205' href='#FN_205' class='fnanchor'>[205]</a> I hear,
while sitting by the wall, the sound of the stake-driver
at a distance,—like that made by a man pumping
in a neighboring farmyard, watering his cattle, or like
chopping wood before his door on a frosty morning,<a name='FA_206' id='FA_206' href='#FN_206' class='fnanchor'>[206]</a>
and I can imagine like driving a stake in a meadow.
The pumper. I immediately went in search of the bird,
but, after going a third of a mile, it did not sound much
nearer, and the two parts of the sound did not appear
to proceed from the same place. What is the peculiarity
of these sounds which penetrate so far on the keynote
of nature? At last I got near to the brook in the meadow
behind Hubbard’s wood, but I could not tell if [it] were
further or nearer than that. When I got within half
a dozen rods of the brook, it ceased, and I heard it no
more. I suppose that I scared it. As before I was
further off than I thought, so now I was nearer than I
thought. It is not easy to understand how so small a
creature can make so loud a sound by merely sucking
in or throwing out water with pump-like lungs.<a name='FA_207' id='FA_207' href='#FN_207' class='fnanchor'>[207]</a> As
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
yet no moon, but downy piles of cloud scattered here
and there in the expectant sky.
</p>

<p>
Saw a blue flag blossom in the meadow while waiting
for the stake-driver.
</p>

<p>
It was a sound as of gulping water.
</p>

<p>
Where my path crosses the brook in the meadow
there is a singularly sweet scent in the heavy air bathing
the brakes, where the brakes grow,—the fragrance of
the earth, as if the dew were a distillation of the fragrant
essences of nature. When I reach the road, the farmer
going home from town invites me to ride in his high-set
wagon, not thinking why I walk, nor can I shortly
explain. He remarks on the coolness of the weather.
The angelica is budded, a handsome luxuriant plant.
And now my senses are captivated again by a sweet
fragrance as I enter the embowered willow causeway,
and I know not if it be from a particular plant or all
together,—sweet-scented vernal grass or sweet-briar.
Now the sun is fairly gone, I hear the dreaming frog,<a name='FA_208' id='FA_208' href='#FN_208' class='fnanchor'>[208]</a>
and the whip-poor-will from some <i>darker</i> wood,—it
is not far from eight,—and the cuckoo. The song
sparrows sing quite briskly among the willows, as if it
were spring again, and the blackbird’s harsher note
resounds over the meadows, and the veery’s comes up
from the wood. Fishes are dimpling the surface of the
river, seizing the insects which alight. A solitary fisherman
in his boat inhabits the scene. As I rose the hill
beyond the bridge, I found myself in a cool, fragrant,
dewy, up-country, mountain morning air, a new region.
(When I had issued from the willows on to the bridge,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
it was like coming out of night into twilight, the river
reflected so much light.) The moon was now seen rising
over Fair Haven and at the same time reflected in the
river, pale and white like a silvery cloud, barred with
a cloud, not promising how it will shine anon. Now I
meet an acquaintance coming from a remote field in his
hay-rigging, with a jag of wood; who reins up to show
me how large a woodchuck he has killed, which he
found eating his clover. But now he must drive on, for
behind comes a boy taking up the whole road with a
huge roller drawn by a horse, which goes lumbering
and bouncing along, getting out of the way of night,—while
the sun has gone the other way,—and making
such a noise as if it had the contents of a tinker’s shop
in its bowels, and rolls the whole road smooth like a
newly sown grain-field.
</p>

<p>
In Conant’s orchard I hear the faint cricket-like song
of a sparrow saying its vespers, as if it were a link
between the cricket and the bird. The robin sings
now, though the moon shines silverly, and the veery
jingles its trill. I hear the fresh and refreshing sound
of falling water, as I have heard it in New Hampshire.
It is a sound we do not commonly hear. I see
that the whiteweed is in blossom, which, as I had
not walked by day for some time, I had not seen
before.
</p>

<p>
How moderate, deliberate, is Nature! How gradually
the shades of night gather and deepen, giving man
ample leisure to bid farewell to-day, conclude his day’s
affairs, and prepare for slumber! The twilight seems
out of proportion to the length of the day. Perchance it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
saves our eyes. Now for some hours the farmers have
been getting home.
</p>

<p>
Since the alarm about mad dogs a couple of years
ago there are comparatively few left to bark at the
traveller and bay the moon. All nature is abandoned
to me.
</p>

<p>
You feel yourself—your body, your legs,—more at
night, for there is less beside to be distinctly known, and
hence perhaps you think yourself more tired than you
are. I see indistinctly oxen asleep in the fields, silent in
majestic slumber, like the sphinx,—statuesque, Egyptian,
reclining. What solid rest! How their heads are
supported! A sparrow or a cricket makes more noise.
From Conant’s summit I hear as many as fifteen whip-poor-wills—or
whip-or-I-wills—at once, the succeeding
cluck sounding strangely foreign, like a hewer at
work elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The moon is accumulating yellow light and triumphing
over the clouds, but still the west is suffused here
and there with a slight red tinge, marking the path of
the day. Though inexperienced ones might call it
night, it is not yet. Dark, heavy clouds lie along the
western horizon, exhibiting the forms of animals and
men, while the moon is behind a cloud. Why do we
detect these forms so readily?—whales or giants reclining,
busts of heroes, Michael-Angelic. There is the
gallery of statuary, the picture gallery of man,—not a
board upon an Italian’s head, but these dark figures
along the horizon,—the board some Titan carries on
his head. What firm and heavy outlines for such soft
and light material!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
</p>

<p>
How sweet and encouraging it is to hear the sound of
some artificial music from the midst of woods or from
the top of a hill at night, borne on the breeze from some
distant farmhouse,—the human voice or a flute!
That is a civilization one can endure, worth having. I
could go about the world listening for the strains of
music. Men use this gift but sparingly, methinks.
What should we think of a bird which had the gift of
song but used it only once in a dozen years, like the
tree which blossoms only once in a century?
</p>

<p>
Now the dorbug comes humming by, the first I have
heard this year. In three months it will be the Harvest
Moon. I cannot easily believe it. Why not call this the
Traveller’s Moon? It would be as true to call the last
(the May) the Planter’s Moon as it is to call September’s
the Harvest Moon, for the farmers use one about as
little as the other. Perhaps this is the Whip-poor-will’s
Moon. The bullfrog now, which I have not heard
before, this evening. It is nearly nine. They are much
less common and their note more intermittent than that
of the dreamers. I scared up a bird on a <i>low</i> bush,
perchance on its nest. It is rare that you start them at
night from such places.
</p>

<p>
Peabody says that the nighthawk retires to rest about
the time the whip-poor-will begins its song. The whip-poor-will
begins now at 7.30. I hear the nighthawk
after 9 o’clock. He says it flies low in the evening, but
it also flies high, as it must needs do to make the
booming sound.
</p>

<p>
I hear the lowing of cows occasionally, and the barking
of dogs. The pond by moonlight, which may make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
the object in a walk, suggests little to be said. Where
there was only one firefly in a dozen rods, I hastily
ran to one which had crawled up to the top of a grass-head
and exhibited its light, and instantly another
sailed in to it, showing its light also; but my presence
made them extinguish their lights. The latter retreated,
and the former crawled slowly down the stem. It
appeared to me that the first was a female who thus
revealed her place to the male, who was also making
known his neighborhood as he hovered about, both
showing their lights that they might come together. It
was like a mistress who had climbed to the turrets of
her castle and exhibited there a blazing taper for a signal,
while her lover had displayed his light on the plain.
If perchance she might have any lovers abroad.
</p>

<p>
Not much before 10 o’clock does the moonlight night
begin. When man is asleep and day fairly forgotten,
then is the beauty of moonlight seen over lonely pastures
where cattle are silently feeding.<a name='FA_209' id='FA_209' href='#FN_209' class='fnanchor'>[209]</a> Then let me walk in
a diversified country, of hill and dale, with heavy woods
one side, and copses and scattered trees and bushes
enough to give me shadows. Returning, a mist is on
the river. The river is taken into the womb of Nature
again.
</p>

<p>
Now is the clover month, but haying is not yet begun.

Evening.—Went to Nawshawtuct by North Branch.
</p>

<p>
Overtaken by a slight shower. The same increased
fragrance from the ground—sweet-fern, etc.—as in the
night, and for the like reason probably. The houstonias
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
still blossom freshly, as I believe they continue to do
all summer. The fever-root in blossom; pictured in
Bigelow’s “Medical Botany.” <i>Triosteum perfoliatum</i>,
near the top of Hill, under the wall, looks somewhat
like a milkweed. The <i>Viburnum dentatum</i>, very regularly
toothed, just ready to blossom; sometimes called
arrow-wood.
</p>

<p>
Nature seems not [to] have designed that man should
be much abroad by night, and in the moon proportioned
the light fitly. By the faintness and rareness of the light
compared with that of the sun, she expresses her intention
with regard to him.

At the Galapagos, the tortoises going to any place

<p>
The productions of the Galapagos Archipelago,
from five to six hundred miles from America, are still
of the American type. “It was most striking to be
surrounded by new birds, new reptiles, new shells, new
insects, new plants, and yet, by innumerable trifling details
of structure, and even by the tones of voice and
plumage of the birds, to have the temperate plains of
Patagonia, or the hot, dry deserts of Northern Chile,
vividly brought before my eyes.” What is most singular,
not only are the plants, etc., to a great extent peculiar
to these islands, but each for the most part has its own
kinds, though they are within sight of each other.
</p>

<p>
Birds so tame that they can be killed with a stick. <i>I</i>
would suggest that, from having dealt so long with the
inoffensive and slow-moulded tortoise, they have not
yet acquired an instinctive fear of man, who is a new-comer.
Methinks tortoises, lizards, etc., for wild creatures
are remarkable for the nearness to which man
approaches them and handles them, as logs,—cold-blooded,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
lumpish forms of life,—only taking care not
to step into their mouths. An alligator has been known
to have come out of the mud like a mud volcano where
was now the floor of a native’s hut.

“The common dock is ... widely disseminated,

Puzzled by a “well rounded fragment of greenstone,
rather larger than a man’s head,” which a captain had
found on a small coral circle or atoll near Keeling
Island, “where every other particle of matter is calcareous,”
about six hundred miles from Sumatra. D.
agrees with Kotzebue (<i>vide</i> Kotzebue) who states that
(Darwin’s words) “the inhabitants of the Radack
Archipelago, a group of lagoon-islands in the midst of
the Pacific, obtained stones for sharpening their instruments
by searching the roots of trees which are cast
upon the beach,” and “laws have been established that
such stones belong to the chief, and a punishment is
inflicted on any one who attempts to steal them.” Let
geologists look out. “Some natives carried by Kotzebue
to Kamtschatka collected stones to take back to their
country.”

Found no bottom at 7200 feet, and 2200 yards from

<p>
His theory of the formation of coral isles by the subsidence
of the land appears probable. He concludes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
that “the great continents are, for the most part, rising
areas; and ... the central parts of the great oceans
are sinking areas.”

Not a <i>private</i> person on the island of Ascension;

<p>
Saw the first wild rose to-day on the west side of the
railroad causeway. The whiteweed has suddenly appeared,
and the clover gives whole fields a rich and
florid appearance,—the rich red and the sweet-scented
white. The fields are blushing with the red species as
the western sky at evening. The blue-eyed grass, well
named, looks up to heaven. And the yarrow, with its
persistent dry stalks and heads, is now ready to blossom
again. The dry stems and heads of last year’s tansy
stand high above the new green leaves.
</p>

<p>
I sit in the shade of the pines to hear a wood thrush
at noon. The ground smells of dry leaves; the heat is
oppressive. The bird begins on a low strain, <i>i. e.</i> it
first delivers a strain on a lower key, then a moment
after another a little higher, then another still varied
from the others,—no two successive strains alike, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
either ascending or descending. He confines himself
to his few notes, in which he is unrivalled, as if his
kind had learned this and no more anciently.
</p>

<p>
I perceive, as formerly, a white froth dripping from
the pitch pines, just at the base of the new shoots. It
has no taste. The pollywogs in the pond are now full-tailed.
The hickory leaves are blackened by a recent
frost, which reminds me that this is near their northern
limit.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable the rapidity with which the grass
grows. The 25th of May I walked to the hills in Wayland,
and when I returned across lots do not remember
that I had much occasion to think of the grass, or to
go round any fields to avoid treading on it; but just a
week afterward, at Worcester, it was high and waving
in the fields, and I was to some extent confined to the
road; and the same was the case here. Apparently in
one month you get from fields which you can cross
without hesitation, to haying time. It has grown you
hardly know when, be the weather what it may, sunshine
or storm. I start up a solitary woodcock in the
shade, in some copse; goes off with a startled, rattling,
hurried note.
</p>

<p>
After walking by night several times I now walk by
day, but I am not aware of any crowning advantage
in it. I see small objects better, but it does not enlighten
me any. The day is more trivial.

What a careful gardener Nature is! She does not let
the sun come out suddenly with all his intensity after

I see the tall crowfoot now in the meadows (<i>Ranunculus
acris</i>), with a smooth stem. I do not notice the
<i>bulbosus</i>, which was so common a fortnight ago. The
rose-colored flowers of the <i>Kalmia angustifolia</i>, lambkill,
just opened and opening. The <i>Convallaria bifolia</i>
growing stale in the woods. The <i>Hieracium venosum</i>,
veiny-leaved hawkweed, with its yellow blossoms in
the woodland path. The <i>Hypoxis erecta</i>, yellow Bethlehem-star,
where there is a thick, wiry grass in open
paths; should be called yellow-eyed grass, methinks.
The <i>Pyrola asarifolia</i>, with its pagoda-like stem of
flowers, <i>i. e</i>. broad-leaved wintergreen. The <i>Trientalis
Americana</i>, like last, in the woods, with its star-like
white flower and pointed whorled leaves. The prunella
too is in blossom, and the rather delicate <i>Thesium
umbellatum</i>, a white flower. The Solomon’s-seal, with
a greenish drooping raceme of flowers at the top, I do
not identify.
</p>

<p>
I notice to-day the same remarkable bushy growth
on the fir (in Wheildon’s garden) that I have noticed
on the pines and cedars. The leaves are not so thickly
set and are much stiffer.

I find that I postpone all actual intercourse with my
friends to a certain real intercourse which takes place
commonly when we are actually at a distance from one

<i>June 22. Sunday.</i> Is the shrub with yellow
blossoms which I found last week near the Lincoln
road while surveying for E. Hosmer and thought to
be <i>Xylosteum ciliatum</i>, or fly honeysuckle, the same
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
with the yellow diervilla which I find in Laurel Glen
to-day?

<p>
The birch is the surveyor’s tree. It makes the best
stakes to look at through the sights of a compass, except
when there is snow on the ground. Their white bark
was not made in vain. In surveying wood-lots I have
frequent occasion to say this is what they were made
for.
</p>

<p>
I see that Dugan has trimmed off and peeled the limbs
of the willows on the Turnpike to sell at the Acton
powder-mill. I believe they get eight dollars a cord for
this wood.
</p>

<p>
I. Hapgood of Acton got me last Friday to compare
the level of his cellar-bottom with his garden, for, as
he says, when Robbins &amp; Wetherbee keep the water of
Nashoba Brook back so as to flood his garden, it comes
into his cellar. I found that part of the garden five
inches lower than the cellar-bottom. Men are affected
in various ways by the actions of others. If a man far
away builds a dam, I have water in my cellar. He said
that the water was sometimes a foot deep in the garden.

<p>
We are enabled to criticise others only when we are
different from, and in a given particular superior to,
them ourselves. By our aloofness from men and their
affairs we are enabled to overlook and criticise them.
There are but few men who stand on the hills by the
roadside. I am sane only when I have risen above my
common sense, when I do not take the foolish view of
things which is commonly taken, when I do not live for
the low ends for which men commonly live. Wisdom
is not common. To what purpose have I senses, if I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
am thus absorbed in affairs? My pulse must beat
with Nature. After a hard day’s work without a thought,
turning my very brain into a mere tool, only in the quiet
of evening do I so far recover my senses as to hear the
cricket, which in fact has been chirping all day. In my
better hours I am conscious of the influx of a serene
and unquestionable wisdom which partly unfits, and if
I yielded to it more rememberingly would wholly unfit
me, for what is called the active business of life, for
that furnishes nothing on which the eye of reason can
rest. What is that other kind of life to which I am thus
continually allured? which alone I love? Is it a life for
this world? Can a man feed and clothe himself gloriously
who keeps only the truth steadily before him? who
calls in no evil to his aid? Are there duties which necessarily
interfere with the serene perception of truth?
Are our serene moments mere foretastes of heaven,—joys
gratuitously vouchsafed to us as a consolation,—or
simply a transient realization of what might be
the whole tenor of our lives?
</p>

<p>
To be calm, to be serene! There is the calmness of
the lake when there is not a breath of wind; there is
the calmness of a stagnant ditch. So is it with us.
Sometimes we are clarified and calmed healthily, as
we never were before in our lives, not by an opiate,
but by some unconscious obedience to the all-just
laws, so that we become like a still lake of purest crystal
and without an effort our depths are revealed to ourselves.
All the world goes by us and is reflected in our
deeps. Such clarity! obtained by such pure means!
by simple living, by honesty of purpose. We live and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
rejoice. I awoke into a music which no one about me
heard. Whom shall I thank for it? The luxury of wisdom!
the luxury of virtue! Are there any intemperate
in these things? I feel my Maker blessing me. To the
sane man the world is a musical instrument. The very
touch affords an exquisite pleasure.
</p>

<p>
As I walk the railroad causeway, I notice that the
fields and meadows have acquired various tinges as the
season advances, the sun gradually using all his paints.
There is the rosaceous evening red tinge of red clover,—like
an evening sky gone down upon the grass,—the
whiteweed tinge, the white clover tinge, which reminds
me how sweet it smells. The tall buttercup stars the
meadow on another side, telling of the wealth of dairies.
The blue-eyed grass, so beautiful near at hand, imparts
a kind of slate or clay blue tinge to the meads.
</p>

<p>
It is hot noon. The white pines are covered with
froth at the base of the new shoots, as I noticed the
pitch pines were a week ago; as if they perspired. I am
threading an open pitch and white pine wood, easily
traversed, where the pine-needles redden all the ground,
which is as smooth as a carpet. Still the blackberries
love to creep over this floor, for it is not many years since
this was a blackberry-field. And I hear around me,
but never in sight, the many wood thrushes whetting
their steel-like notes. Such keen singers! It takes a fiery
heat, many dry pine leaves added to the furnace of the
sun, to temper their strains! Always they are either
rising or falling to a new strain. After what a moderate
pause they deliver themselves again! saying ever a
new thing, avoiding repetition, methinks answering one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
another. While most other birds take their siesta, the
wood thrush discharges his song. It is delivered like
a bolas, or a piece of jingling steel.
</p>

<p>
The domestic ox has his horns tipped with brass.
This and his shoes are the badges of servitude which he
wears; as if he would soon get to jacket and trousers.
I am singularly affected when I look over a herd of reclining
oxen in their pasture, and find that every one
has these brazen balls on his horns. They are partly
humanized so. It is not pure brute; there is art added.
Where are these balls sold? Who is their maker? The
bull has a ring in his nose.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Lysimachia quadrifolia</i> exhibits its small yellow
blossoms now in the wood-path. Butter-and-eggs has
blossomed. The <i>Uvularia vulgaris</i>, or bladderwort, a
yellow pea-like flower, has blossomed in stagnant pools.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 23.</i> It is a pleasant sound to me, the squeaking
and the booming of nighthawks flying over high
open fields in the woods. They fly like butterflies, not to
avoid birds of prey but, apparently, to secure their own
insect prey. There is a particular part of the railroad
just below the shanty where they may be heard and
seen in greatest numbers. But often you must look a
long while before you can detect the mote in the sky
from which the note proceeds.
</p>

<p>
The common cinquefoil (<i>Potentilla simplex</i>) greets
me with its simple and unobtrusive yellow flower in the
grass. The <i>P. argentea</i>, hoary cinquefoil, also is now
in blossom. <i>P. sarmentosa</i>, running cinquefoil, we had
common enough in the spring.

Visited a menagerie this afternoon. I am always surprised
to see the same spots and stripes on wild beasts
from Africa and Asia and also from South America,—on
the Brazilian tiger and the African leopard,—and
their general similarity. All these wild animals—lions,
tigers, chetas, leopards, etc.—have one hue,—tawny
and commonly spotted or striped,—what you may call
pard-color, a color and marking which I had not associated
with America. These are wild beasts. What
constitutes the difference between a wild beast and a
tame one? How much more human the one than the
other! Growling, scratching, roaring, with whatever
beauty and gracefulness, still untamable, this royal
Bengal tiger or this leopard. They have the character
and the importance of another order of men. The
majestic lion, the king of beasts,—he must retain his
title.
</p>

<p>
I was struck by the gem-like, changeable, greenish
reflections from the eyes of the grizzly bear, so glassy
that you never saw the surface of the eye. They [were]
quite demonic. Its claws, though extremely large and
long, look weak and made for digging or pawing the
earth and leaves. It is unavoidable, the idea of transmigration;
not merely a fancy of the poets, but an instinct
of the race.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>June 29.</i> There is a great deal of white clover this
year. In many fields where there has been no clover seed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
sown for many years at least, it is more abundant than
the red, and the heads are nearly as large. Also pastures
which are close cropped, and where I think there
was little or no clover last year, are spotted white with
a humbler growth. And everywhere, by roadsides, garden
borders, etc., even where the sward is trodden hard,
the small white heads on short stems are sprinkled
everywhere. As this is the season for the swarming of
bees, and this clover is very attractive to them, it is
probably the more difficult to secure them; at any rate
it is the more important to secure their services now
that they can make honey so fast. It is an interesting
inquiry why this year is so favorable to the growth of
clover!
</p>

<p>
I am interested to observe how old-country methods
of farming resources are introduced among us. The
Irish laborer, for instance, seeing that his employer is
contemplating some agricultural enterprise, as ditching
or fencing, suggests some old-country mode with
[which] he has been familiar from a boy, which is often
found to be cheaper as well as more ornamental than
the common; and Patrick is allowed to accomplish the
object his own way, and for once exhibits some skill
and has not to be shown, but, working with a will as
well as with pride, does better than ever in the old
country. Even the Irishman exhibits what might be mistaken
for a Yankee knack, exercising a merely inbred
skill derived from the long teachings and practice of
his ancestors.
</p>

<p>
I saw an Irishman building a bank of sod where his
employer had contemplated building a bank wall, piling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
up very neatly and solidly with his spade and a line
the sods taken from the rear, and coping the face at a
very small angle from the perpendicular, intermingling
the sods with bushes as they came to hand, which would
grow and strengthen the whole. It was much more
agreeable to the eye, as well as less expensive, than
stone would have been, and he thought that it would be
equally effective as a fence and no less durable. But
it is true only experience will show when the same practice
may be followed in this climate and in Ireland,—whether
our atmosphere is not too dry to admit of it.
At any rate it was wise in the farmer thus to avail himself
of any peculiar experience which his hired laborer
possessed. That was what he <i>should</i> buy.
</p>

<p>
Also I noticed the other day where one who raises
seeds, when his ropes and poles failed, had used ropes
twisted of straw to support his plants,—a resource
probably suggested and supplied by his foreign laborers.
It is only remarkable that so few improvements or resources
are or are to be adopted from the Old World.
</p>

<p>
I look down on rays of prunella by the roadsides now.
The panicled or privet andromeda with its fruit-like
white flowers. Swamp-pink I see for the first time this
season.
</p>

<p>
The tree-primrose (scabish)<a name='FA_212' id='FA_212' href='#FN_212' class='fnanchor'>[212]</a> (<i>Œnother biennais</i>), a
rather coarse yellow flower with a long tubular calyx,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
naturalized extensively in Europe. The clasping bellflower
(<i>Campanula perfoliata</i>, from the heart-shaped
leaves clasping the stalk), an interesting flower.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Convolvulus sepium</i>, large bindweed, make a
fresh morning impression as of dews and purity. The
adder’s-tongue arethusa, a delicate pink flower.
</p>

<p>
How different is day from day! Yesterday the air
was filled with a thick fog-like haze, so that the sun did
not once shine with ardor, but everything was so tempered
under this thin veil that it was a luxury merely
to be outdoors,—you were less out for it. The shadows
of the apple trees even early in the afternoon were
remarkably distinct. The landscape wore a classical
smoothness. Every object was as in [a] picture with a
glass over it. I saw some hills on this side the river,
looking from Conantum, on which, the grass being of
a yellow tinge, though the sun did not shine out on
them, they had the appearance of being shone upon
peculiarly. It was merely an unusual yellow tint of the
grass. The mere surface of water was an object for
the eye to linger on.
</p>

<p>
The panicled cornel, a low shrub, in blossom by wall-sides

I thought that one peculiarity of my “Week” was its
<i>hypæthral</i> character, to use an epithet applied to those
Egyptian temples which are open to the heavens above,
<i>under the ether</i>. I thought that it had little of the atmosphere
of the house about it, but might wholly have
been written, as in fact it was to a considerable extent,
out-of-doors. It was only at a late period in writing it,
as it happened, that I used any phrases implying that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
I lived in a house or led a <i>domestic</i> life. I trust it does
not smell [so much] of the study and library, even of
the poet’s attic, as of the fields and woods; that it is
a hypæthral or unroofed book, lying open under the
ether and permeated by it, open to all weathers, not
easy to be kept on a shelf.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Riding to survey a wood-lot yesterday, I observed
that a dog accompanied the wagon. Having tied the
horse at the last house and entered the woods, I saw no
more of the dog while there; but when riding back to
the village, I saw the dog again running by the wagon,
and in answer to my inquiry was told that the horse and
wagon were hired and that the dog always accompanied
the horse. I queried whether it might happen that
a dog would accompany the wagon if a strange horse
were put into it; whether he would ever attach himself
to an inanimate object. Methinks the driver, though
a stranger, as it were added intellect to the mere animality
of the horse, and the dog, not making very nice
distinctions, yielded respect to the horse and equipage
as if it were human. If the horse were to trot off
alone without a wagon or driver, I think it doubtful
if the dog would follow; if with the wagon, then the
chances of his following would be increased; but if
with a driver, though a stranger, I have found by experience
that he would follow.
</p>

<p>
At a distance in the meadow I hear still, at long intervals,
the hurried commencement of the bobolink’s
strain, the bird just dashing into song, which is as
suddenly checked, as it were, by the warder of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
seasons, and the strain is left incomplete forever. Like
human beings they are inspired to sing only for a short
season.<a name='FA_213' id='FA_213' href='#FN_213' class='fnanchor'>[213]</a>

<p>
That little roadside pea-like-blossomed blue flower<a name='FA_214' id='FA_214' href='#FN_214' class='fnanchor'>[214]</a>
is interesting to me. The mulleins are just blossoming.
</p>

<p>
The voice of the crickets, heard at noon from deep
in the grass, allies day to night. It is unaffected by
sun and moon. It is a midnight sound heard at noon,
a midday sound heard at midnight.
</p>

<p>
I observed some mulleins growing on the western
slope of the sandy railroad embankment, in as warm
a place as can easily be found, where the heat was reflected
from the sand oppressively at 3 o’clock <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
this hot day; yet the green and living leaves felt rather
cool than otherwise to the hand, but the dead ones at
the root were quite warm. The living plant thus preserves
a cool temperature in the hottest exposure, as
if it kept a cellar below, from which cooling liquors
were drawn up.

<p>
Yarrow is now in full bloom, and elder, and a small
many-headed white daisy like a small whiteweed. The
epilobium, too, is out.
</p>

<p>
The night-warbler sings the same strain at noon.
The song sparrow still occasionally reminds me of
spring.
</p>

<p>
I observe that the high water in the ponds, which
have been rising for a year, has killed most of the pitch
pines and alders which it had planted and merely
watered at its edge during the years of dryness. But
now it comes to undo its own work.

There seem to be no bounds to our unworthiness.

<i>June 30.</i> Haying has commenced. I see the farmers
in distant fields cocking their hay now at six o’clock.
The day has been so oppressively warm that some
workmen have lain by at noon, and the haymakers are
mowing now in the early twilight.

The blue flag (<i>Iris versicolor</i>) enlivens the meadow.
The lark sings at sundown off in the meadow. It is a
note which belongs to a New England summer evening.
Though so late, I hear the summer hum of a bee in
the grass, as I am on my way to the river behind Hubbard’s
to bathe. After hoeing in a dusty garden all
this warm afternoon,—so warm that the baker says
he never knew the like and expects to find his horses
dead in the stable when he gets home,—it is very
grateful to wend one’s way at evening to some pure
and cool stream and bathe therein.
</p>

<p>
The cranberry is now in blossom. Their fresh shoots
have run a foot or two over the surface.
</p>

<p>
I have noticed an abundance of poison sumach this
season. It is now in blossom. In some instances it has
the size and form of a healthy peach tree.
</p>

<p>
The cuckoo is faintly heard from a neighboring grove.
Now that it is beginning to be dark, as I am crossing a
pasture I hear a happy, cricket-like, shrill little lay from
a sparrow, either in the grass or else on that distant
tree, as if it were the vibrations of a watch-spring; its
vespers. The tree-primrose, which was so abundant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
in one field last Saturday, is now all gone. The cattle
on Bear Garden Hill, seen through the twilight, look
monstrously large. I find abounding in the meadows the
adder’s-tongue arethusa and occasionally with it the
<i>Cymbidium tuberosum</i> of the same tint. The obtuse
galium is a delicate vine-like plant with a minute white
blossom in the same places. The St. John’s-wort has
blossomed. The (<i>Œnothera pumila</i>, or dwarf tree-primrose,
a neat yellow flower, abounds in the meadows;
which the careless would mistake at a distance for
buttercups. The white buds of the clethra (alder-leaved)
rise above their recent shoots. The narrow-leaved
cotton-grass spots the meadow with white,
seeming like loose down, its stems are so slight. The
carrot growing wild which I observed by the railroad
is now blossoming, with its dishing blossom. I found
by the railroad, a quarter of a mile from the road,
some common garden catch-fly, the pink flower, growing
wild. Angelica is now in blossom, with its large
umbels. Swamp rose, fugacious-petalled. The prinos,
or winterberry, budded, with white clustered berry-like
flower-buds, is a pretty contrast to itself in the winter,—wax-like.
While bathing I plucked the common
floating plant like a small yellow lily, the yellow water
ranunculus (<i>R. multifidus</i>). What I suppose is the
<i>Aster miser</i>, small-flowered aster, like a small many-headed
whiteweed, has now for a week been in bloom;
a humble weed, but one of the earliest of the asters.<a name='FA_215' id='FA_215' href='#FN_215' class='fnanchor'>[215]</a>
The umbelled thesium, a simple white flower, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
edge of the woods. <i>Erysimum officinale</i>, hedge mustard,
with its yellow flowers.
</p>

<p>
I first observed about ten days ago that the fresh
shoots of the fir balsam (<i>Abies balsamifera</i>), found under
the tree wilted, or plucked and kept in the pocket or in
the house a few days, emit the fragrance of strawberries,
only it is somewhat more aromatic and spicy. It was to
me a very remarkable fragrance to be emitted by a pine.
A very rich, delicious, aromatic, spicy fragrance, which
if the fresh and living shoots emitted, they would be still
more to be sought after.

<p>
Saw a brood of young partridges yesterday, a little
larger than robins.

<h2>
VI
<br />
JULY, 1851
<br />
(ÆT. 33-34)
</h2>

<p>
<i>July 2.</i> It is a fresh, cool summer morning. From
the road at N. Barrett’s, on my way to P. Blood’s at
8.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, the Great Meadows have a slight bluish
misty tinge in part; elsewhere a sort of hoary sheen
like a fine downiness, inconceivably fine and silvery
far away,—the light reflected from the grass blades,
a sea of grass hoary with light, the counterpart of the
frost in spring. As yet no mower has profaned it;
scarcely a footstep since the waters left it. Miles of
waving grass adorning the surface of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Last night, a sultry night which compelled to leave
all windows open, I heard two travellers talking aloud,
was roused out of my sleep by their loud, day-like, and
somewhat unearthly discourse at perchance one o’clock.
From the country, whiling away the night with loud
discourse. I heard the words “Theodore Parker” and
“Wendell Phillips” loudly spoken, and so did half a
dozen of my neighbors, who also were awakened. Such
is fame. It affected [me] like Dante talking of the men
of this world in the infernal regions. If the travellers
had called my own name I should equally have thought
it an unearthly personage which it would take me some
hours into daylight to realize. O traveller, haven’t you
got any further than that? My genius hinted before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
I fairly awoke, “Improve your time.” What is the
night that a traveller’s voice should sound so hollow
in it? that a man speaking aloud in the night, speaking
in regions under the earth, should utter the words
“Theodore Parker”?
</p>

<p>
A traveller! I love his title. A traveller is to be reverenced
as such. His profession is the best symbol of
our life. Going from —— toward ——; it is the history
of every one of us. I am interested in those that travel
in the night.
</p>

<p>
It takes but little distance to make the hills and even
the meadows look blue to-day. That principle which
gives the air an azure color is more abundant.
</p>

<p>
To-day the milkweed is blossoming. Some of the
raspberries are ripe, the most innocent and simple of
fruits, the purest and most ethereal. Cherries are ripe.
Strawberries in the gardens have passed their prime.
</p>

<p>
Many large trees, especially elms, about a house are
a surer indication of old family distinction and worth
than any evidence of wealth. Any evidence of care
bestowed on these trees secures the traveller’s respect
as for a nobler husbandry than the raising of corn and
potatoes.
</p>

<p>
I passed a regular country dooryard this forenoon,
the unpainted one-story house, long and low with projecting
stoop, a deep grass-plot unfenced for yard, hens
and chickens scratching amid the chip dirt about the
door,—this last the main feature, relics of wood-piles,
sites of the wooden towers.
</p>

<p>
The nightshade has bloomed and the prinos, or
winterberry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 5.</i> The vetch-like flower by the Marlborough
road, the <i>Tephrosia Virginica</i>, is in blossom, with mixed
red and yellowish blossoms. Also the white fine-flowered
Jersey tea (<i>Ceanothus Americana</i>), and, by the side
of wood-paths, the humble cow-wheat (<i>Apocynum</i>, etc.).
The blue flower by the roadside, slender but pretty
spike, is the pale lobelia (<i>L. pallida</i>). The reddish
blossoms of the umbelled wintergreen (<i>Pyrola umbellata</i>)
are now in perfection and are exceedingly beautiful.
Also the white sweet-scented flowers of the <i>P.
rotundifolia</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is a remarkably cool, clear, breezy atmosphere
to-day. One would say there were fewer flowers just
now than there have been and are to be; <i>i. e.</i> we do
not look so much for the blossoming of new flowers.
The earliest small fruits are just beginning to be ripe,—the
raspberry, thimble-berry, blueberry, etc. We have
no longer the blossoms of those which must ripen their
fruits in early autumn.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in those fields in the woods where the
potato is cultivated, growing in the light, dry, sandy
soil, free from weeds; now in blossom, the slight vine
not crowded in the hill. I think they do not promise
many potatoes, though mealy and wholesome like nuts.
Many fields have now received their last hoeing, and
the farmers’ work seems to be soon over with them.
What a pleasant interview he must have had with them!
What a liberal education with these professors! Better
than a university. It is pleasing to consider man’s
cultivating this plant thus assiduously, without reference
to any crop it may yield him, as if he were to cultivate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
johnswort in like manner. What influences does he
receive from this long intercourse.
</p>

<p>
The flowers of the umbelled pyrola, or common
wintergreen, are really very handsome now, dangling
red from their little umbels like jewelry,—especially
the unexpanded buds with their red calyx-leaves against
the white globe of petals.
</p>

<p>
There is a handsome wood-path on the east side of
White Pond. The shadows of the pine stems and
branches falling across the path, which is perfectly
red with pine-needles, make a very handsome carpet.
Here is a small road running north and south along
the edge of the wood, which would be a good place to
walk by moonlight.
</p>

<p>
The calamint grows by the lane beyond Seven-Star
Lane; now in blossom.
</p>

<p>
As we come over Hubbard’s Bridge between 5 and
6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, the sun getting low, a cool wind blowing up
the valley, we sit awhile on the rails which are destined
for the new railing. The light on the Indian hill is very
soft and glorious, giving the idea of the most wonderful
fertility. The most barren hills are gilded like waving
grain-fields. What a paradise to sail by! The cliffs and
woods up the stream are nearer and have more shadow
and actuality about them. This retired bridge is a favorite
spot with me. I have witnessed many a fair sunset
from it.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 6. Sunday.</i> I walked by night last moon, and
saw its disk reflected in Walden Pond, the broken disk,
now here, now there, a pure and memorable flame
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
unearthly bright, like a cucullo<a name='FA_216' id='FA_216' href='#FN_216' class='fnanchor'>[216]</a> of a water-bug. Ah!
but that first faint tinge of moonlight on the gap! (seen
some time ago),<a name='FA_217' id='FA_217' href='#FN_217' class='fnanchor'>[217]</a>—a silvery light from the east before
day had departed in the west. What an immeasurable
interval there is between the first tinge of moonlight
which we detect, lighting with mysterious, silvery, poetic
light the western slopes, like a paler grass, and the last
wave of daylight on the eastern slopes! It is wonderful
how our senses ever span so vast an interval, how from
being aware of the one we become aware of the other.
And now the night wind blows,—from where? What
gave it birth? It suggests an interval equal to that
between the most distant periods recorded in history.
The silver age is not more distant from the golden than
moonlight is from sunlight. I am looking into the west,
where the red clouds still indicate the course of departing
day. I turn and see the silent, spiritual, contemplative
moonlight shedding the softest imaginable light on the
western slopes of the hills, as if, after a thousand years
of polishing, their surfaces were just beginning to be
bright,—a pale whitish lustre. Already the crickets
chirp to the moon a different strain, and the night
wind rustles the leaves of the wood. A different dynasty
has commenced. Yet moonlight, like daylight, is more
valuable for what it suggests than for what it actually is.
It is a long past season of which I dream. And the
reason is perchance because it is a more sacred and
glorious season, to which I instantly refer all glorious
actions in past time. Let a nobler landscape present
itself, let a purer air blow, and I locate all the worthies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
of the world. Ah, there is the mysterious light which
for some hours has illustrated Asia and the scene of
Alexander’s victories, now at length, after two or three
hours spent in surmounting the billows of the Atlantic,
come to shine on America. There, on that illustrated
sand-bank, was revealed an antiquity beside which
Nineveh is young. Such a light as sufficed for the
earliest ages. From what star has it arrived on this
planet? Yet even at midday I see the full moon shining
in the sky. What if, in some vales, only its light
is reflected? What if there are some spirits which walk
in its light alone still? who separate the moonlight from
the sunlight, and are shined on by the former only? I
passed from dynasty to dynasty, from one age of the
world to another age of the world, from Jove perchance
back to Saturn. What river of Lethe was
there to run between? I bade farewell to that light
setting in the west and turned to salute the new light
rising in the east.
</p>

<p>
There is some advantage in being the humblest,
cheapest, least dignified man in the village, so that the
very stable boys shall damn you. Methinks I enjoy
that advantage to an unusual extent. There is many a
coarsely well-meaning fellow, who knows only the skin
of me, who addresses me familiarly by my Christian
name. I get the whole good of him and lose nothing
myself. There is “Sam,” the jailer,—whom I never
call Sam, however,—who exclaimed last evening:
“Thoreau, are you going up the street pretty soon?
Well, just take a couple of these handbills along and
drop one in at Hoar’s piazza and one at Holbrook’s,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
and I’ll do as much for you another time.” I am not
above being used, aye abused, sometimes.
</p>

<p>
The red clover heads are now turned black. They no
longer impart that rosaceous tinge to the meadows and
fertile fields. It is but a short time that their rich bloom
lasts. The white is black or withering also. Whiteweed
still looks white in the fields. Blue-eyed grass is now
rarely seen. The grass in the fields and meadows is not
so fresh and fair as it was a fortnight ago. It is dryer
and riper and ready for the mowers. Now June is past.
June is the month for grass and flowers. Now grass
is turning to hay, and flowers to fruits. Already I gather
ripe blueberries on the hills. The red-topped grass is
in its prime, tingeing the fields with red.
</p>

<p>
It is a free, flowing wind, with wet clouds in the sky,
though the sun shines. The distant hills look unusually
near in this atmosphere. Acton meeting-houses seen
to stand on the side of some hills, Nagog or Nashoba,
beyond, as never before. Nobscot looks like a high
pasture in the sunlight not far off. From time to time
I hear a few drops of rain falling on the leaves, but none
is felt and the sun does not cease to shine. All serious
showers go round me and get out of my way.
</p>

<p>
The clasping harebell is certainly a pretty flower, and
so is the tephrosia. The poke has blossomed and the
indigo-weed.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 7.</i> The intimations of the night are divine,
methinks. Men might meet in the morning and report
the news of the night,—what divine suggestions have
been made to them. I find that I carry with me into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
the day often some such hint derived from the gods,—such
impulses to purity, to heroism, to literary effort
even, as are never day-born.<a name='FA_218' id='FA_218' href='#FN_218' class='fnanchor'>[218]</a>
</p>

<p>
One of those mornings which usher in no day, but
rather an endless morning, a protracted auroral season,
for clouds prolong the twilight the livelong day.
</p>

<p>
And now that there is an interregnum in the blossoming
of the flowers, so is there in the singing of the birds.
The golden robin is rarely heard, and the bobolink, etc.
</p>

<p>
I rejoice when in a dream I have loved virtue and
nobleness.
</p>

<p>
Where is Grecian history? It is when in the morning
I recall the intimations of the night.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The moon is now more than half full. When I come
through the village at 10 o’clock this cold night, cold
as in May, the heavy shadows of the elms covering the
ground with their rich tracery impress me as if men
had got so much more than they had bargained for,
not only trees to stand in the air, but to checker the
ground with their shadows. At night they lie along
the earth. They tower, they arch, they droop over the
streets like chandeliers of darkness. In my walk the
other afternoon, I saw the sun shining into the depths
of a thick pine wood, checkering the ground like moonlight
and illuminating the lichen-covered bark of a
large white pine, from which it was reflected through
the surrounding thicket as from another sun. This
was so deep in the woods that you would have said no
sun could penetrate thither.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I have been to-night with Anthony Wright to look
through Perez Blood’s telescope a second time. A
dozen of Blood’s neighbors were swept along in the
stream of our curiosity. One who lived half a mile this
side said that Blood had been down that way within
a day or two with his terrestrial, or day, glass, looking
into the eastern horizon [at] the hills of Billerica, Burlington,
and Woburn. I was amused to see what sort
of respect this man with a telescope had obtained from
his neighbors, something akin to that which savages
award to civilized men, though in this case the interval
between the parties was very slight. Mr. Blood, with
his skull-cap on, his short figure, his north European
figure, made me think of Tycho Brahe. He did not
invite us into his house this cool evening,—men nor
women,—nor did he ever before to my knowledge. I
am still contented to see the stars with my naked eye.
Mr. Wright asked him what his instrument cost. He
answered, “Well, that is something I don’t like to tell.”
(Stuttering or hesitating in his speech a little as usual.)
“It is a very proper question, however.” “Yes,” said
I, “and you think that you have given a very proper
answer.”
</p>

<p>
Returning, my companion, Wright, the sexton, told
me how dusty he found it digging a grave that afternoon,—for
one who had been a pupil of mine. For
two feet, he said, notwithstanding the rain, he found
the soil as dry as ashes.
</p>

<p>
With a certain wariness, but not without a slight
shudder at the danger oftentimes, I perceive how near
I had come to admitting into my mind the details of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
some trivial affair, as a case at court; and I am astonished
to observe how willing men are to lumber
their minds with such rubbish,—to permit idle rumors,
tales, incidents, even of an insignificant kind, to
intrude upon what should be the sacred ground of the
thoughts. Shall the temple of our thought be a public
arena where the most trivial affairs of the market and
the gossip of the tea-table is discussed,—a dusty, noisy,
trivial place? Or shall it be a quarter of heaven itself, a
place consecrated to the service of the gods, a hypæthral
temple? I find it so difficult to dispose of the few facts
which to me are significant, that I hesitate to burden
my mind with the most insignificant, which only a divine
mind could illustrate. Such is, for the most part, the news,—in
newspapers and conversation. It is important to
preserve the mind’s chastity in this respect. Think of
admitting the details of a single case of the criminal
court into the mind, to stalk profanely through its very
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> for an hour, aye, for many hours!
to make a very bar-room of your mind’s inmost apartment,
as if for a moment the dust of the street had occupied
you, aye, the very street itself, with all its travel,
passed through your very mind of minds, your thoughts’
shrine, with all its filth and bustle! Would it not be
an intellectual suicide? By all manner of boards and
traps, threatening the extreme penalty of the divine
law, excluding trespassers from these grounds, it behooves
us to preserve the purity and sanctity of the
mind.<a name='FA_219' id='FA_219' href='#FN_219' class='fnanchor'>[219]</a> It is so hard to forget what it is worse than
useless to remember. If I am to be a channel or thoroughfare,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
I prefer that it be of the mountain springs,
and not the town sewers,—the Parnassian streams.
There is inspiration, the divine gossip which comes
to the ear of the attentive mind from the courts of
heaven; there is the profane and stale revelation of the
bar-room and the police court. The same ear is fitted
to receive both communications. Only the character
of the individual determines to which source chiefly
it shall be open and to which closed. I believe that
the mind can be profaned by the habit of attending to
trivial things, so that all our thoughts shall be tinged
with triviality. They shall be dusty as stones in the
street. Our very minds shall be paved and macadamized,
as it were, their foundation broken into fragments
for the wheels of travel to roll over. If we have thus
desecrated ourselves, the remedy will be, by circumspection
and wariness, by our aspiration and devotion,
to consecrate ourselves, to make a fane of the mind.
I think that we should treat our minds as innocent
and ingenuous children whose guardians we are,—be
careful what objects and what subjects we thrust on
their attention. Even the facts of science may dust the
mind by their dryness, unless they are in a sense effaced
each morning, or rather rendered fertile by the dews
of fresh and living truth. Every thought that passes
through the mind helps to wear and tear it, and to
deepen the ruts, which, as in the streets of Pompeii,
evince how much it has been used. How many things
there are concerning which we might well deliberate
whether we had better know them!<a name='FA_220' id='FA_220' href='#FN_220' class='fnanchor'>[220]</a> Routine, conventionality,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
manners, etc., etc.,—how insensibly an undue
attention to these dissipates and impoverishes the
mind, robs it of its simplicity and strength, emasculates
it!
</p>

<p>
Knowledge does not come to us by details but by
<i>lieferungs</i> from the gods. What else is it to wash and
purify ourselves? Conventionalities are as bad as impurities.<a name='FA_221' id='FA_221' href='#FN_221' class='fnanchor'>[221]</a>
Only thought which is expressed by the mind
in repose—as it were, lying on its back and contemplating
the heavens—is adequately and fully expressed.
What are sidelong, transient, passing half-views?
The writer expressing his thought must be
as well seated as the astronomer contemplating the
heavens; he must not occupy a constrained position.
The facts, the experience, we are well poised upon!
which secures our whole attention!
</p>

<p>
The senses of children are unprofaned. Their whole
body is one sense; they take a physical pleasure in
riding on a rail, they love to teeter. So does the unviolated,
the unsophisticated mind derive an inexpressible
pleasure from the simplest exercise of thoughts.
</p>

<p>
I can express adequately only the thought which I
<i>love</i> to express. All the faculties in repose but the one
you are using, the whole energy concentrated in that.
Be ever so little distracted, your thoughts so little confused,
your engagements so few, your attention so free,
your existence so mundane, that in all places and in all
hours you can hear the sound of crickets in those seasons
when they are to be heard. It is a mark of serenity and
health of mind when a person hears this sound much,—in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
streets of cities as well as in fields. Some ears
never hear this sound; are called deaf. Is it not because
they have so long attended to other sounds?

<i>July 8. Tuesday.</i> Walked along the Clamshell bank
after sundown. A cloudy sky. The heads of the grass
in the pasture behind Dennis’s have a reddish cast,
but another grass, with a lighter-colored stem and
leaves, on the higher parts of the field gives a yellowish
tinge to those parts, as if they reflected a misty
sunlight. Even much later in the night these light spots
were distinguishable. I am struck by the cool, juicy,
pickled-cucumber green of the potato-fields now. How
lusty these vines look! The pasture naturally exhibits
at this season no such living green as the
cultivated fields. I perceive that flower of the
lowlands now, with a peculiar leaf and conspicuous
white umbels.<a name='FA_222' id='FA_222' href='#FN_222' class='fnanchor'>[222]</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are mulleins covering a field (the Clamshell
field) where three years [ago] were none noticeable,
but a smooth uninterrupted pasture sod. Two years
ago it was plowed for the first time for many years,
and millet and corn and potatoes planted, and now
<i>where the millet grew</i> these mulleins have sprung up.
Who can write the history of these fields? The millet
does not perpetuate itself, but the few seeds of the mullein,
which perchance were brought here with it, are
still multiplying the race.

Here are some rich rye-fields waving over all the land,
their heads nodding in the evening breeze with an apparently
alternating motion; <i>i. e.</i> they do not all bend
at once by ranks, but separately, and hence this agreeable
alternation. How rich a sight this cereal fruit,
now yellow for the cradle,—<i>flavus</i>! It is an impenetrable
phalanx. I walk for half a mile beside these
Macedonians, looking in vain for an opening. There
is no Arnold Winkelried to gather these spear-heads
upon his breast and make an opening for me. This is
food for man. The earth labors not in vain; it is bearing
its burden. The yellow, waving, rustling rye extends far
up and over the hills on either side, a kind of pinafore to
nature, leaving only a narrow and dark passage at the
bottom of a deep ravine. How rankly it has grown!
How it hastes to maturity! I discover that there is such
a goddess as Ceres. These long grain-fields which you
must respect,—must go round,—occupying the ground
like an army. The small trees and shrubs seen dimly
in its midst are overwhelmed by the grain as by an
inundation. They are seen only as indistinct forms of
bushes and green leaves mixed with the yellow stalks.
There are certain crops which give me the idea of bounty,
of the <i>Alma Natura</i>.<a name='FA_223' id='FA_223' href='#FN_223' class='fnanchor'>[223]</a> They are the grains. Potatoes
do not so fill the lap of earth. This rye excludes everything
else and takes possession of the soil. The farmer
says, “Next year I will raise a crop of rye;” and he
proceeds to clear away the brush, and either plows it,
or, if it is too uneven or stony, burns and harrows it
only, and scatters the seed with faith. And all winter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
the earth keeps his secret,—unless it did leak out somewhat
in the fall,—and in the spring this early green on
the hillsides betrays him. When I see this luxuriant
crop spreading far and wide in spite of rock and bushes
and unevenness of ground, I cannot help thinking that
it must have been unexpected by the farmer himself,
and regarded by him as a lucky accident for which to
thank fortune. This, to reward a transient faith, the
gods had given. As if he must have forgotten that he
did it, until he saw the waving grain inviting his sickle.

<i>July 9.</i> When I got out of the cars at Porter’s, Cambridge,
this morning, I was pleased to see the handsome
blue flowers of the succory or endive (<i>Cichorium Intybus</i>),
which reminded me that within the hour I had been
whirled into a new botanical region. They must be
extremely rare, if they occur at all, in Concord. This
weed is handsomer than most garden flowers. Saw
there also the <i>Cucubalus Behen</i>, or bladder campion,
also the autumnal dandelion (<i>Apargia autumnalis</i>).
</p>

<p>
Visited the Observatory. Bond said they were cataloguing
the stars at Washington (?), or trying to. They
do not at Cambridge; of no use with their force. Have
not force enough now to make mag[netic] obs[ervations].
When I asked if an observer with the small telescope
could find employment, he said, Oh yes, there was employment
enough for observation with the naked eye,
observing the changes in the brilliancy of stars, etc., etc.,
if they could only get some good observers. One is glad
to hear that the naked eye still retains some importance
in the estimation of astronomers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Coming out of town,—willingly as usual,—when
I saw that reach of Charles River just above the depot,
the fair, still water this cloudy evening suggesting the
way to eternal peace and beauty, whence it flows, the
placid, lake-like fresh water, so unlike the salt brine,
affected me not a little. I was reminded of the way in
which Wordsworth so coldly speaks of some natural
visions or scenes “giving him pleasure.” This is perhaps
the first vision of elysium on this route from Boston.
And just then I saw an encampment of Penobscots,
their wigwams appearing above the railroad fence,
they, too, looking up the river as they sat on the ground,
and enjoying the scene. What can be more impressive
than to look up a noble river just at evening,—one,
perchance, which you have never explored,—and behold
its placid waters, reflecting the woods and sky,
lapsing inaudibly toward the ocean; to behold as a lake,
but know it as a river, tempting the beholder to explore
it and his own destiny at once? Haunt of waterfowl.
This was above the factories,—all that I saw. That
water could never have flowed under a factory. How
<i>then</i> could it have reflected the sky?
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 10.</i> A gorgeous sunset after rain, with horizontal
bars of clouds, red sashes to the western window, barry
clouds hanging like a curtain over the window of the
west, damask. First there is a low arch of the storm
clouds in the west, under which is seen the clearer,
fairer, serener sky and more distant sunset clouds, and
under all, on the horizon’s edge, heavier, massive dark
clouds, not to be distinguished from the mountains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
How many times I have seen this kind of sunset,—the
most gorgeous sight in nature! From the hill behind
Minott’s I see the birds flying against this red sky, the
sun having set; one looks like a bat. Now between two
stupendous mountains of the low stratum under the
evening red, clothed in slightly rosaceous amber light,
through a magnificent gorge, far, far away, as perchance
may occur in pictures of the Spanish coast viewed from
the Mediterranean, I see a city, the eternal city of the
west, the phantom city, in whose streets no traveller has
trod, over whose pavements the horses of the sun have
already hurried, some Salamanca of the imagination.
But it lasts only for a moment, for now the changing
light has wrought such changes in it that I see the resemblance
no longer.
</p>

<p>
A softer amber sky than in any picture. The swallows
are improving this short day, twittering as they fly, and
the huckleberry-bird<a name='FA_224' id='FA_224' href='#FN_224' class='fnanchor'>[224]</a> repeats his jingling strain, and
the song sparrow, more honest than most.
</p>

<p>
I am always struck by the centrality of the observer’s
position. He always stands fronting the middle of the
arch, and does not suspect at first that a thousand observers
on a thousand hills behold the sunset sky from
equally favorable positions.
</p>

<p>
And now I turn and observe the dark masses of the
trees in the east, not green but black. While the sun
was setting in the west, the trees were rising in the east.
</p>

<p>
I perceive that the low stratum of dark clouds under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
the red sky all dips one way, and to a remarkable degree
presents the appearance of the butt ends of cannons
slanted toward the sky, thus:—
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-332" id="i-332"></a>
<img src="images/i-332.jpg" width="534" height="64" alt="Shape of Clouds" />
</div>
<p>
Such uniformity on a large scale is unexpected and pleasant
to detect, evincing the simplicity of the laws of
their formation. Uniformity in the shapes of clouds of
a single stratum is always to be detected, the same wind
shaping clouds of the like consistency and in like positions.
No doubt an experienced observer could discover
the states of the upper atmosphere by studying the forms
and characters of the clouds. I traced the distinct form
of the cannon in seven instances, stretching over the
whole length of the cloud, many a mile in the horizon.
</p>

<p>
And the nighthawk dashes past in the twilight with
mottled (?) wing, within a rod of me.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 11. Friday.</i> At 7.15 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> with W. E. C. go
forth to see the moon, the glimpses of the moon. We
think she is not quite full; we can detect a little flatness
on the eastern side. Shall we wear thick coats? The day
has been warm enough, but how cool will the night be?
It is not sultry, as the last night. As a general rule, it
is best to wear your thickest coat even in a July night.
Which way shall we walk? Northwest, that we may
see the moon returning? But on that side the river prevents
our walking in the fields, and on other accounts
that direction is not so attractive. We go toward Bear
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
Garden Hill. The sun is setting. The meadow-sweet
has bloomed. These dry hills and pastures are the
places to walk by moonlight. The moon is silvery still,
not yet inaugurated. The tree-tops are seen against
the amber west. I seem to see the outlines of one spruce
among them, distinguishable afar. My thoughts expand
and flourish most on this barren hill, where in the
twilight I see the moss spreading in rings and prevailing
over the short, thin grass, carpeting the earth, adding
a few inches of green to its circle annually while it dies
within.
</p>

<p>
As we round the sandy promontory, we try the sand
and rocks with our hands. The sand is cool on the surface
but warmer a few inches beneath, though the contrast
is not so great as it was in May. The larger rocks
are perceptibly warm. I pluck the blossom of the milkweed
in the twilight and find how sweet it smells. The
white blossoms of the Jersey tea dot the hillside, with
the yarrow everywhere. Some woods are black as clouds;
if we knew not they were green by day, they would appear
blacker still. When we sit, we hear the mosquitoes hum.
The woodland paths are not the same by night as by
day; if they are a little grown up, the eye cannot find
them, but must give the reins to the feet, as the traveller
to his horse. So we went through the aspens at the base
of the Cliffs, their round leaves reflecting the lingering
twilight on the one side, the waxing moonlight on the
other. Always the path was unexpectedly open.
</p>

<p>
Now we are getting into moonlight. We see it reflected
from particular stumps in the depths of the
darkest woods, and from the stems of trees, as if it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
selected what to shine on,<a name='FA_225' id='FA_225' href='#FN_225' class='fnanchor'>[225]</a>—a silvery light. It is a light,
of course, which we have had all day, but which we
have not appreciated, and proves how remarkable a
lesser light can be when a greater has departed. How
simply and naturally the moon presides! ’T is true she
was eclipsed by the sun, but now she acquires an almost
equal respect and worship by reflecting and representing
him, with some new quality, perchance, added to his
light, showing how original the disciple may be who still
in midday is seen, though pale and cloud-like, beside
his master. Such is a worthy disciple. In his master’s
presence he still is seen and preserves a distinct existence;
and in his absence he reflects and represents
him, not without adding some new quality to his light,
not servile and never rival. As the master withdraws
himself, the disciple, who was a pale cloud before,
begins to emit a silvery light, acquiring at last a tinge
of golden as the darkness deepens, but not enough to
scorch the seeds which have been planted or to dry up
the fertilizing dews which are falling.
</p>

<p>
Passing now near Well Meadow Head toward Baker’s
orchard. The sweet-fern and indigo-weed fill the path
up to one’s middle, wetting us with dews so high. The
leaves are shining and flowing.<a name='FA_226' id='FA_226' href='#FN_226' class='fnanchor'>[226]</a> We wade through the
luxuriant vegetation, seeing no bottom. Looking back
toward the Cliffs, some dead trees in the horizon, high
on the rocks, make a wild New Hampshire prospect.
There is the faintest possible mist over the pond-holes,
where the frogs are eructating, like the falling of huge
drops, the bursting of mephitic air-bubbles rising from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
the bottom, a sort of blubbering,—such conversation
as I <i>have</i> heard between men, a belching conversation,
expressing a sympathy of stomachs and abdomens. The
peculiar appearance of the indigo-weed, its misty massiveness,
is striking. In Baker’s orchard the thick grass
looks like a sea of mowing in this weird moonlight, a
bottomless sea of grass. Our feet must be imaginative,
must know the earth in imagination only, as well as our
heads. We sit on the fence, and, where it is broken and
interrupted, the fallen and slanting rails are lost in the
grass (really thin and wiry) as in water. We even see
our tracks a long way behind, where we have brushed
off the dew. The clouds are peculiarly wispy to-night,
somewhat like fine flames, not massed and dark nor
downy, not thick, but slight, thin wisps of mist.
</p>

<p>
I hear the sound of Heywood’s Brook falling into
Fair Haven Pond, inexpressibly refreshing to my senses.
It seems to flow through my very bones. I hear it with
insatiable thirst. It allays some sandy heat in me. It
affects my circulations; methinks my arteries have
sympathy with it. What is it I hear but the pure waterfalls
within me, in the circulation of my blood, the
streams that fall into my heart? What mists do I ever
see but such as hang over and rise from my blood?
The sound of this gurgling water, running thus by
night as by day, falls on all my dashes, fills all my
buckets, overflows my float-boards, turns all the machinery
of my nature, makes me a flume, a sluice-way,
to the springs of nature. Thus I am washed; thus I
drink and quench my thirst.<a name='FA_227' id='FA_227' href='#FN_227' class='fnanchor'>[227]</a> Where the streams fall
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
into the lake, if they are only a few inches more elevated,
all walkers may hear.
</p>

<p>
On the high path through Baker’s wood I see, or rather
feel, the tephrosia. Now we come out into the open
pasture. And under those woods of elm and buttonwood,
where still no light is seen, repose a family of
human beings. By night there is less to distinguish this
locality from the woods and meadows we have threaded.
We might go very near to farmhouses covered with ornamental
trees and standing on a highroad, thinking that
[we] were in the most retired woods and fields still.
Having yielded to sleep, man is a less obtrusive inhabitant
of nature. Now, having reached the dry pastures
again, we are surrounded by a flood of moonlight. The
dim cart-path over the sward curves gracefully through
the pitch pines, ever to some more fairy-like spot. The
rails in the fences shine like silver. We know not whether
we are sitting on the ruins of a wall, or the materials
which are to compose a new one. I see, half a mile off,
a phosphorescent arc on the hillside, where Bartlett’s
Cliff reflects the moonlight. Going by the shanty, I smell
the excrements of its inhabitants, which I had never
smelt before.
</p>

<p>
And now, at half-past 10 o’clock, I hear the cockerels
crow in Hubbard’s barns, and morning is already anticipated.
It is the feathered, wakeful thought in us that
anticipates the following day. This sound is wonderfully
exhilarating at all times. These birds are worth
far more to me for their crowing and cackling than for
their drumsticks and eggs.<a name='FA_228' id='FA_228' href='#FN_228' class='fnanchor'>[228]</a> How singular the connection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
of the hen with man,—that she leaves her eggs in
his barns always! She is a domestic fowl, though still
a little shyish of him. I cannot [help] looking at the
whole as an experiment still and wondering that in each
case it succeeds. There is no doubt at last but hens
may be kept. They will put their eggs in your barn by
a tacit agreement. They will not wander far from your
yard.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 12.</i> 8 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—Now at least the moon is full,
and I walk alone, which is best by night, if not by day
always. Your companion must sympathize with the present
mood. The conversation must be located where the
walkers are, and vary exactly with the scene and events
and the contour of the ground. Farewell to those who
will talk of nature unnaturally, whose presence is an
interruption. I know but one with whom I can walk.
I might as well be sitting in a bar-room with them as
walk and talk with most. We are never side by side in
our thoughts, and we cannot hear each other’s silence.
Indeed, we cannot be silent. We are forever breaking
silence, that is all, and mending nothing. How can they
keep together who are going different ways!
</p>

<p>
I start a sparrow from her three eggs in the grass,
where she had settled for the night. The earliest corn
is beginning to show its tassels now, and I scent it as
I walk,—its peculiar dry scent.<a name='FA_229' id='FA_229' href='#FN_229' class='fnanchor'>[229]</a> (This afternoon I
gathered ripe blackberries, and felt as if the autumn
had commenced.) Now perchance many sounds and
sights only remind me that they once said something to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
me, and are so by association interesting. I go forth to
be reminded of a previous state of existence, if perchance
any memento of it is to be met with hereabouts.
I have no doubt that Nature preserves her integrity.
Nature is in as rude health as when Homer sang. We
may at last by our sympathies be well. I see a skunk
on Bear Garden Hill stealing noiselessly away from me,
while the moon shines over the pitch pines, which send
long shadows down the hill. Now, looking back, I see
it shining on the south side of farmhouses and barns
with a weird light, for I pass here half an hour later
than last night. I smell the huckleberry bushes. I hear
a human voice,—some laborer singing after his day’s
toil,—which I do not often hear. Loud it must be, for
it is far away. Methinks I should know it for a white
man’s voice. Some strains have the melody of an
instrument. Now I hear the sound of a bugle in the
“Corner,” reminding me of poetic wars; a few flourishes
and the bugler has gone to rest. At the foot of the
Cliff hill I hear the sound of the clock striking nine, as
distinctly as within a quarter of a mile usually, though
there is no wind. The moonlight is more perfect than
last night; hardly a cloud in the sky,—only a few
fleecy ones. There is more serenity and more light. I
hear that sort of throttled or chuckling note as of a bird
flying high, now from this side, then from that.<a name='FA_230' id='FA_230' href='#FN_230' class='fnanchor'>[230]</a> Methinks
when I turn my head I see Wachusett from the
side of the hill. I smell the butter-and-eggs as I walk.
I am startled by the rapid transit of some wild animal
across my path, a rabbit or a fox,—or you hardly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
know if it be not a bird. Looking down from the cliffs,
the leaves of the tree-tops shine more than ever by day.
Here and there a lightning-bug shows his greenish light
over the tops of the trees.
</p>

<p>
As I return through the orchard, a foolish robin
bursts away from his perch unnaturally, with the habits
of man. The air is remarkably still and unobjectionable
on the hilltop, and the whole world below is covered
as with a gossamer blanket of moonlight. It is
just about as yellow as a blanket. It is a great dimly
burnished shield with darker blotches on its surface.
You have lost some light, it is true, but you have got
this simple and magnificent stillness, brooding like
genius.<a name='FA_231' id='FA_231' href='#FN_231' class='fnanchor'>[231]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 13.</i> Observed yesterday, while surveying near
Gordon’s, a bittern flying over near Gordon’s, with
moderate flight and outstretched neck, its breast-bone
sticking out sharp like the bone in the throats
of some persons, its anatomy exposed. The evergreen
is very handsome in the woods now, rising somewhat
spirally in a round tower of five or six stories, surmounted
by a long bud. Looking across the river to
Conantum from the open plains, I think how the history
of the hills would read, since they have been
pastured by cows, if every plowing and mowing and
sowing and chopping were recorded. I hear, 4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>,
a pigeon woodpecker on a dead pine near by, uttering
a harsh and scolding scream, spying me. The
chewink jingles on the tops of the bushes, and the rush
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
sparrow,<a name='FA_232' id='FA_232' href='#FN_232' class='fnanchor'>[232]</a> the vireo, and oven-bird at a distance; and
a robin sings, superior to all; and a barking dog has
started something on the opposite side of the river;
and now the wood thrush surpasses them all. These
plains are covered with shrub oaks, birches, aspens,
hickories, mingled with sweet-fern and brakes and
huckleberry bushes and epilobium, now in bloom, and
much fine grass. The hellebore by the brooksides has
now fallen over, though it is not broken off. The cows
now repose and chew the cud under the shadow of a
tree, or crop the grass in the shade along the side of the
woods, and when you approach to observe them they
mind you just enough. I turn up the <i>Juniperus repens</i>,
and see the lighter color of its leaves on the under sides,
and its berries with three petal-like divisions in one
end. The sweet-scented life-everlasting is budded.
</p>

<p>
This might be called the Hayer’s or Haymaker’s
Moon, for I perceive that when the day has been oppressively
warm the haymakers rest at noon and resume
their mowing after sunset, sometimes quite into
evening.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 14.</i> Passing over the Great Fields (where I have
been surveying a road) this forenoon, where were some
early turnips, the county commissioners plucked and
pared them with their knives and ate them. I, too,
tried hard to chew a mouthful of raw turnip and realize
the life of cows and oxen, for it might be a useful habit
in extremities. These things occur as the seasons revolve.
These are things which travellers will do. How many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
men have tasted a raw turnip! How few have eaten a
whole one! Some bovine appetites, which find some
fodder in every field. For like reasons we sometimes
eat sorrel and say we love it, that we may return the
hospitality of Nature by exhibiting a good appetite.
</p>

<p>
The citizen looks sharp to see if there is any dogwood
or poison sumach in the swamp before he enters.
</p>

<p>
If I take the same walk by moonlight an hour later
or earlier in the evening, it is as good as a different one.
I love the night for its novelty; it is less prophaned
than the day.<a name='FA_233' id='FA_233' href='#FN_233' class='fnanchor'>[233]</a>
</p>

<p>
The creaking of the crickets seems at the very foundation
of all sound. At last I cannot tell it from a ringing
in my ears. It is a sound from within, not without.
You cannot dispose of it by listening to it. In proportion
as I am stilled I hear it. It reminds me that I am
a denizen of the earth.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 16. Wednesday.</i> Methinks my present experience
is nothing; my past experience is all in all. I think
that no experience which I have to-day comes up to,
or is comparable with, the experiences of my boyhood.
And not only this is true, but as far back as I can remember
I have unconsciously referred to the experiences
of a previous state of existence. “For life is a
forgetting,” etc. Formerly, methought, nature developed
as I developed, and grew up with me. My life
was ecstasy. In youth, before I lost any of my senses,
I can remember that I was all alive, and inhabited
my body with inexpressible satisfaction; both its weariness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
and its refreshment were sweet to me. This earth
was the most glorious musical instrument, and I was
audience to its strains. To have such sweet impressions
made on us, such ecstasies begotten of the breezes!
I can remember how I was astonished. I said to myself,—I
said to others,—“There comes into my mind
such an indescribable, infinite, all-absorbing, divine,
heavenly pleasure, a sense of elevation and expansion,
and [I] have had nought to do with it. I perceive that
I am dealt with by superior powers.<a name='FA_234' id='FA_234' href='#FN_234' class='fnanchor'>[234]</a> This is a pleasure,
a joy, an existence which I have not procured myself.
I speak as a witness on the stand, and tell what I have
perceived.” The morning and the evening were sweet
to me, and I led a life aloof from society of men. I wondered
if a mortal had ever known what I knew. I looked
in books for some recognition of a kindred experience,
but, strange to say, I found none. Indeed, I was slow
to discover that other men had had this experience, for
it had been possible to read books and to associate with
men on other grounds. The maker of me was improving
me. When I detected this interference I was profoundly
moved. For years I marched as to a music in comparison
with which the military music of the streets is noise
and discord. I was daily intoxicated, and yet no man
could call me intemperate. With all your science can
you tell how it is, and whence it is, that light comes into
the soul?

The song sparrow, the most familiar and New England
bird, is heard in fields and pastures, setting this
midsummer day to music, as if it were the music of a
mossy rail or fence post; a little stream of song, cooling,
rippling through the noon,—the usually unseen songster
usually unheard like the cricket, it is so common,—like
the poet’s song, unheard by most men, whose ears
are stopped with business, though perchance it sang on
the fence before the farmer’s house this morning for an
hour. There are little strains of poetry in our animals.
</p>

<p>
Berries are just beginning to ripen, and children are
planning expeditions after them. They are important
as introducing children to the fields and woods, and as
wild fruits of which much account is made. During
the berry season the schools have a vacation, and many
little fingers are busy picking these small fruits. It is
ever a pastime, not a drudgery. I remember how glad
I was when I was kept from school a half a day to
pick huckleberries on a neighboring hill all by myself
to make a pudding for the family dinner. Ah, they got
nothing but the pudding, but I got invaluable experience
beside! A half a day of liberty like that was like
the promise of life eternal. It was emancipation in
New England. O, what a day was there, my countrymen!
</p>

<p>
I see the yellow butterflies now gathered in fleets in
the road, and on the flowers of the milkweed (<i>Asclepias
pulchra</i>) by the roadside, a really handsome flower; also
the smaller butterfly, with reddish wings, and a larger,
black or steel-blue, with wings spotted red on edge, and
one of equal size, reddish copper-colored. Now you may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
see a boy stealing after one, hat in hand. The earliest
corn begins to tassel out, and my neighbor has put his
hand in the hill some days ago and abstracted some
new potatoes as big as nuts, then covered up again.
Now they will need—or will get—no more weeding.
The lark sings in the meadow; the very essence of the
afternoon is in his strain. This is a New England sound,
but the cricket is heard under all sounds. Still the cars
come and go with the regularity of nature, of the sun and
moon. (If a hen puts her eggs elsewhere than in the
barns,—in woods or among rocks,—she is said to
<i>steal</i> her nest!) The twittering of swallows is in the air,
reminding me of water. The meadow-sweet is now in
bloom, and the yarrow prevails by all roadsides. I see
the hardhack too, homely but dear plant, just opening
its red clustered flowers. The small aster, too, now
abounds (<i>Aster miser</i>),<a name='FA_235' id='FA_235' href='#FN_235' class='fnanchor'>[235]</a> and the tall buttercup still.
After wading through a swamp the other day with my
shoes in my hand, I wiped my feet with sassafras leaves,
which reminded me of some Arabian practices, the
bruised leaves perfuming the air and by their softness
being adapted to this purpose. The tree-primrose, or
scabish, still is seen over the fence. The red-wings and
crow blackbirds are heard chattering on the trees, and
the cow troopials are accompanying the cows in the
pastures for the sake of the insects they scare up. Oftentimes
the thoughtless sportsman has lodged his charge
of shot in the cow’s legs or body in his eagerness to obtain
the birds. St. John’s-wort, one of the first of yellow
flowers, begins to shine along the roadside. The mullein
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
for some time past. I see a farmer cradling his rye,
John Potter. Fields are partly mown,—some English
grass on the higher parts of the meadow next to the road.
The farmer’s work comes not all at once. In haying
time there is a cessation from other labors to a considerable
extent. Planting is done, and hoeing mainly;
only some turnip seed is to be scattered amid the corn.
I hear the kingbird twittering or chattering like a stout-chested
swallow. The prunella sends back a blue ray
from under my feet as I walk; the pale lobelia too. The
plaintive, spring-restoring peep of a bluebird is occasionally
heard. I met loads of hay on the road, which
the oxen draw indifferently, swaggering in their gait, as
if it were not fodder for them. Methinks they should
testify sometimes that they are working for themselves.
The whiteweed is turning black. Grapes are half grown
and lead the mind forward to autumn. It is an air this
afternoon that makes you indifferent to all things,—perfect
summer, but with a comfortable breeziness.
You know not heat nor cold. What season of the year
is this? The balls of the button-bush are half formed,
with its fine, glossy, red-stemmed leaf atoning for its
nakedness in the spring. My eye ranges over green
fields of oats, for which there is a demand then somewhere.
The wild rose peeps from amid the alders and
other shrubs by the roadside. The elder-blow fills the
air with its scent. The angelica, with its large umbels, is
gone to seed. On it I find one of those slow-moving
green worms, with rings spotted black and yellow, like
an East Indian production. What if these grew as large
as elephants? The honest and truly fair is more modestly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
colored. Notwithstanding the drifting clouds,
you fear no rain to-day. As you walk, you smell some
sweet herbage, but detect not what it is. Hay is sticking
to the willows and the alders on the causeway, and
the bridge is sprinkled with it. The hemlock (<i>Cicuta
Americana</i>) displays its white umbels now. The yellow
lilies reign in the river. The painted tortoises drop off
the willow stumps as you go over the bridge. The river
is now so low that you can see its bottom, shined on by
the sun, and travellers stop to look at fishes as they go
over, leaning on the rails. The pickerel-weed sends
up its heavenly blue. The color of the cows on Fair
Haven Hill, how fair a contrast to the hillside! How
striking and wholesome their clean brick-red! When
were they painted? How carelessly the eye rests on
them, or passes them by as things of course! The tansy
is budded. The devil’s-needles seem to rest in air over
the water. There is nothing New-English about them.
</p>

<p>
Now, at 4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, I hear the pewee in the woods, and
the cuckoo reminds me of some silence among the birds
I had not noticed. The vireo (red-eyed?) sings like a
robin at even, incessantly,—for I have now turned
into Conant’s woods. The oven-bird helps fill some
pauses. The poison sumach shows its green berries,
now unconscious of guilt. The heart-leaved loosestrife
(<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>) is seen in low open woods. The
breeze displays the white under sides of the oak leaves
and gives a fresh and flowing look to the woods. The
river is a dark-blue winding stripe amid the green of the
meadow. What is the color of the world? Green mixed
with yellowish and reddish for hills and ripe grass, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
darker green for trees and forests; blue spotted with
dark and white for sky and clouds, and dark blue for
water. Beyond the old house I hear the squirrel chirp
in the wall like a sparrow; so Nature merges her creations
into one. I am refreshed by the view of Nobscot
and the southwestern vales, from Conantum, seething
with the blue element. Here comes a small bird with a
ricochet flight and a faint twittering note like a messenger
from Elysium. The rush sparrow jingles her
small change, pure silver, on the counter of the pasture.
From far I see the rye stacked up. A few dead trees
impart the effect of wildness to the landscape, though
it is a feature rare in an old settled country.
</p>

<p>
Methinks this is the first of dog-days. The air in the
distance has a peculiar blue mistiness, or furnace-like
look, though, as I have said, it is not sultry yet. It is
not the season for distant views. Mountains are not
<i>clearly</i> blue now. The air is the opposite to what it is
in October and November. You are not inclined to
travel. It is a world of orchards and small-fruits now,
and you can stay at home if the well has cool water in
it. The black thimble-berry is an honest, homely berry,
now drying up as usual. I used to have a pleasant time
stringing them on herd’s-grass stems, tracing the wall-sides
for them. It is pleasant to walk through these
elevated fields, terraced upon the side of the hill so that
the eye of the walker looks off into the blue cauldron
of the air at his own level. Here the haymakers have
just gone to tea,—at 5 o’clock, the farmer’s hour, before
the afternoon is ended, while he still thinks much
work may still be done before night. He does not wait
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
till he is strongly reminded of the night. In the distance
some burdened fields are black with haycocks. Some
thoughtless and cruel sportsman has killed twenty-two
young partridges not much bigger than robins, against
the laws of Massachusetts and humanity. At the Corner
Bridge the white lilies are budded. Green apples
are now so large as to remind me of coddling and the
autumn again.<a name='FA_236' id='FA_236' href='#FN_236' class='fnanchor'>[236]</a> The season of fruits is arrived. The
dog’s-bane has a pretty, delicate bell-like flower. The
Jersey tea abounds. I see the marks of the scythes
in the fields, showing the breadth of each swath the
mowers cut. Cool springs are now a desideratum. The
geranium still hangs on. Even the creeping vines love
the brooks, and I see where one slender one has struggled
down and dangles into the current, which rocks it
to and fro. Filberts are formed, and you may get the
berry stains out of your hands with their husks, if you
have any. Nightshade is in blossom. Came through the
pine plains behind James Baker’s, where late was open
pasture, now open pitch pine woods, only here and there
the grass has given place to a carpet of pine-needles.
These are among our pleasantest woods,—open, level,
with blackberry vines interspersed and flowers, as lady’s-slippers,
earlier, and pinks on the outskirts. Each tree
has room enough. And now I hear the wood thrush
from the shade, who loves these pine woods as well as
I. I pass by Walden’s scalloped shore. The epilobium
reflects a pink gleam up the vales and down the hills.
The chewink jingles on a bush’s top. Why will the
Irishman drink of a puddle by the railroad instead of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
digging a well? How shiftless! What death in life! He
cannot be said to live who does not get pure water.
</p>

<p>
The milkweeds, or silkweeds, are rich flowers, now in
blossom. The <i>Asclepias syriaca</i>, or common milkweed;
its buds fly open at a touch. But handsomer much is
<i>Asclepias pulchra</i>, or water silkweed. The thin green
bark of this last, and indeed of the other, is so strong
that a man cannot break a small strip of it by pulling.
It contains a mass of fine silken fibres, arranged side
by side like the strings of a fiddle-bow, and may be bent
short without weakening it.
</p>

<p class="p2">
What more glorious condition of being can we imagine
than from impure to be becoming pure? It is
almost desirable to be impure that we may be the subject
of this improvement. That I am innocent to myself!
That I love and reverence my life! That I am
better fitted for a lofty society to-day than I was yesterday!
To make my life a sacrament! What is nature
without this lofty tumbling? May I treat myself with
more and more respect and tenderness. May I not forget
that I am impure and vicious. May I not cease to
love purity. May I go to my slumbers as expecting to
arise to a new and more perfect day. May I so live and
refine my life as fitting myself for a society ever higher
than I actually enjoy. May I treat myself tenderly as
I would treat the most innocent child whom I love;
may I treat children and my friends as my newly discovered
self. Let me forever go in search of myself;
never for a moment think that I have found myself;
be as a stranger to myself, never a familiar, seeking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
acquaintance still. May I be to myself as one is to me
whom I love, a dear and cherished object. What temple,
what fane, what sacred place can there be but the
innermost part of my own being? The possibility of
my own improvement, that is to be cherished. As I
regard myself, so I am. O my dear friends, I have not
forgotten you. I will know you to-morrow. I associate
you with my ideal self. I had ceased to have faith in
myself. I thought I was grown up and become what
I was intended to be, but it is earliest spring with me.
In relation to virtue and innocence the oldest man is
in the beginning spring and vernal season of life. It
is the love of virtue makes us young ever. That is
the fountain of youth, the very aspiration after the
perfect. I love and worship myself with a love which
absorbs my love for the world. The lecturer suggested
to me that I might become better than I am. Was
it not a good lecture, then? May I dream not that I
shunned vice; may I dream that I loved and practiced
virtue.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 18.</i> It is a test question affecting the youth of a
person,—Have you knowledge of the morning? Do
you sympathize with that season of nature? Are you
abroad early, brushing the dews aside? If the sun rises
on you slumbering, if you do not hear the morning
cock-crow, if you do not witness the blushes of Aurora,
if you are not acquainted with Venus as the morning
star, what relation have you to wisdom and purity?
You have then forgotten your Creator in the days of
your youth! Your shutters were darkened till noon!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
You rose with a sick headache! In the morning sing,
as do the birds. What of those birds which should
slumber on their perches till the sun was an hour
high? What kind of fowl would they be and new kind
of bats and owls,—hedge sparrows or larks? then
took a dish of tea or hot coffee before they began to
sing?
</p>

<p>
I might have added to the list of July 16th the <i>Aralia
hispida</i>, bristling aralia; the heart-leaved loosestrife
(<i>Lysimachia ciliata</i>); also the upright loosestrife (<i>L.
racemosa</i>), with a rounded terminal raceme; the tufted
vetch (<i>Vicia cracca</i>). Sweet-gale fruit now green.
</p>

<p>
I first heard the locust sing, so dry and piercing, by
the side of the pine woods in the heat of the day.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 19.</i> Here I am thirty-four years old,<a name='FA_237' id='FA_237' href='#FN_237' class='fnanchor'>[237]</a> and yet
my life is almost wholly unexpanded. How much is in
the germ! There is such an interval between my ideal
and the actual in many instances that I may say I am
unborn. There is the instinct for society, but no society.
Life is not long enough for one success. Within another
thirty-four years that miracle can hardly take place.
Methinks my seasons revolve more slowly than those
of nature; I am differently timed. I am contented.
This rapid revolution of nature, even of nature in me,
why should it hurry me? Let a man step to the music
which he hears, however measured. Is it important that
I should mature as soon as an apple tree? aye, as soon
as an oak? May not my life in nature, in proportion as
it is supernatural, be only the spring and infantile portion
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
of my spirit’s life? Shall I turn my spring to summer?
May I not sacrifice a hasty and petty completeness
here to entireness there? If my curve is large, why
bend it to a smaller circle? My spirit’s unfolding observes
not the pace of nature. The society which I was
made for is not here. Shall I, then, substitute for the
anticipation of that this poor reality? I would [rather]
have the unmixed expectation of that than this reality.
If life is a waiting, so be it. I will not be shipwrecked
on a vain reality. What were any reality which I can
substitute? Shall I with pains erect a heaven of blue
glass over myself, though when it is done I shall be
sure to gaze still on the true ethereal heaven far above,
as if the former were not,—that still distant sky o’er-arching
that blue expressive eye of heaven?<a name='FA_238' id='FA_238' href='#FN_238' class='fnanchor'>[238]</a> I am
enamored of the blue-eyed arch of heaven.
</p>

<p>
<i>I</i> did not <i>make</i> this demand for a more thorough
sympathy. This is not my idiosyncrasy or disease.
He that made the demand will answer the demand.
</p>

<p>
My blood flows as slowly as the waves of my native
Musketaquid; yet they reach the ocean sooner, perchance,
than those of the Nashua.
</p>

<p>
Already the goldenrod is budded, but I can make no
haste for that.
</p>

<p class="p2">
2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—The weather is warm and dry, and many
leaves curl. There is a threatening cloud in the southwest.
The farmers dare not spread their hay. It remains
cocked in the fields. As you walk in the woods
nowadays, the flies striking against your hat sound
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
like rain-drops. The stump or root fences on the Corner
road remind me of fossil remains of mastodons,
etc., exhumed and bleached in sun and rain. To-day
I met with the first orange flower of autumn. What
means this doubly torrid, this Bengal, tint? Yellow
took sun enough, but this is the fruit of a dog-day sun.
The year has but just produced it. Here is the Canada
thistle in bloom, visited by butterflies and bees. The
butterflies have swarmed within these few days, especially
about the milkweeds. The swamp-pink still fills
the air with its perfume in swamps and by the causeways,
though it is far gone. The wild rose still scatters
its petals over the leaves of neighboring plants. The
wild morning-glory or bindweed, with its delicate red
and white blossoms. I remember it ever as a goblet full
of purest morning air and sparkling with dew, showing
the dew-point, winding round itself for want of other
support. It grows by the Hubbard Bridge causeway,
near the angelica. The cherry-birds are making their
<i>seringo</i> sound as they flit past. They soon find out the
locality of the cherry trees. And beyond the bridge
there is a goldenrod partially blossomed. Yesterday it
was spring, and to-morrow it will be autumn. Where
is the summer then? First came the St. John’s-wort
and now the goldenrod to admonish us. I hear, too,
a cricket amid these stones under the blackberry vines,
singing as in the fall. Ripe blackberries are multiplying.
I see the red-spotted berries of the small Solomon’s-seal
in my path. I notice, in the decayed end of an oak
post, that the silver grain is not decayed, but remains
sound in thin flakes, alternating with the decayed portions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
and giving the whole a honeycombed look. Such
an object supramundane, as even a swallow may descend
to light on, a dry mullein stalk for instance. I
see that hens, too, follow the cows feeding near the
house, like the cow troopial, and for the same object.
They cannot so well scare up insects for themselves.
This is the dog the cowbird uses to start up its insect
game. I see yellow butterflies in pairs, pursuing each
other a rod or two into the air, and now, as he had
bethought himself of the danger of being devoured by
a passing bird, he descends with a zigzag flight to the
earth, and the other follows. The black huckleberries
are now so thick among the green ones that they no
longer incur suspicion of being worm-eaten.
</p>

<p>
When formerly I was looking about to see what I
could do for a living, some sad experience in conforming
to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to
tax my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking
huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its small
profits might suffice, so little capital it required, so little
distraction from my wonted thoughts, I foolishly thought.
While my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade
or the professions, I thought of this occupation as most
like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick the
berries which came in my way, which I might carelessly
dispose of; so to keep the flocks of King Admetus. My
greatest skill has been to want but little. I also dreamed
that I might gather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens
to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods
and so find my living got. But I have since learned that
trade curses everything it handles; and though you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
<i>trade</i> in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade
attaches to the business.<a name='FA_239' id='FA_239' href='#FN_239' class='fnanchor'>[239]</a>
</p>

<p>
The wind rises more and more. The river and the
pond are blacker than the threatening cloud in the south.
The thunder mutters in the distance. The surface of
the water is slightly rippled. Where the pads grow is
a light green border. The woods roar. Small white
clouds are hurrying across the dark-blue ground of the
storm, which rests on all the woods of the south horizon.
But still no rain now for some hours, as if the clouds
were dissipated as fast as they reached this atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
The barberry’s fruit hangs yellowish-green. What
pretty covers the thick bush makes, so large and wide and
drooping! The <i>Fringilla juncorum</i> sings still, in spite of
the coming tempest, which, perchance, only threatens.
</p>

<p>
The woodchuck is a good native of the soil. The distant
hillside and the grain-fields and pastures are spotted
yellow or white with his recent burrows, and the small
mounds remain for many years. Here where the clover
has lately been cut, see what a yellow mound is brought
to light!
</p>

<p>
Heavily hangs the common yellow lily (<i>Lilium
Canadense</i>) in the meadows. In the thick alder copses
by the causeway-side I find the <i>Lysimachia hybrida</i>.
Here is the <i>Lactuca sanguinea</i> with its runcinate leaves,
tall stem, and pale-crimson ray. And that green-stemmed
one higher than my head, resembling the
last in its leaves, is perchance the “tall lettuce,” or
fireweed. Can that fine white-flowered meadow-plant
with the <img src="images/i-355.jpg" width="66" height="64" alt="Leaf" /> leaf be a thalictrum?

<p class="p2">
<i>July 20. Sunday morning.</i> A thunder-shower in the
night. Thunder near at hand, though louder, is a
more trivial and earthly sound than at a distance; likened
to sounds of men. The clap which waked me last
night was as if some one was moving lumber in an upper
apartment, some vast hollow hall, tumbling it down
and dragging it over the floor; and ever and anon the
lightning filled the damp air with light, like some vast
glow-worm in the fields of ether opening its wings.
</p>

<p>
The river, too, steadily yields its crop. In louring days
it is remarkable how many villagers resort to it. It is
of more worth than many gardens. I meet one, late in
the afternoon, going to the river with his basket on his
arm and his pole in hand, not ambitious to catch pickerel
this time, but he thinks he may perhaps get a mess
of small fish. These [<i>sic</i>] kind of values are real and
important, though but little appreciated, and he is not
a wise legislator who underrates them and allows the
bridges to be built low so as to prevent the passage
of small boats. The town is but little conscious how
much interest it has in the river, and might vote it away
any day thoughtlessly. There is always to be seen either
some unshaven wading man, an old mower of the river
meadows, familiar with water, vibrating his long pole
over the lagoons of the off-shore pads, or else some solitary
fisher, in a boat behind the willows, like a mote
in the sunbeams reflecting the light; and who can tell
how many a mess of river fish is daily cooked in the
town? They are an important article of food to many
a poor family.

4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> Annursnack.—The under sides of the leaves,
exposed by the breeze, give a light bluish tinge to the
woods as I look down on them. Looking at the woods
west of this hill, there is a grateful dark shade under
their eastern sides, where they meet the meadows, their
cool night side,—a triangular segment of night, to
which the sun has set. The mountains look like waves
on a blue ocean tossed up by a stiff gale. The <i>Rhexia
Virginica</i> is in bloom.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 21.</i> 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—The forenoon is fuller of light. The
butterflies on the flowers look like other and frequently
larger flowers themselves. Now I yearn for one of those
old, meandering, dry, uninhabited roads, which lead
away from towns, which lead us away from temptation,
which conduct to the outside of earth, over its
uppermost crust; where you may forget in what country
you are travelling; where no farmer can complain
that you are treading down his grass, no gentleman
who has recently constructed a seat in the country
that you are trespassing; on which you can go off at
half-cock and wave adieu to the village; along which
you may travel like a pilgrim, going nowhither; where
travellers are not too often to be met; where my spirit
is free; where the walls and fences are not cared for;
where your head is more in heaven than your feet are
on earth; which have long reaches where you can see
the approaching traveller half a mile off and be prepared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
for him; not so luxuriant a soil as to attract men;
some root and stump fences which do not need attention;
where travellers have no occasion to stop, but
pass along and leave you to your thoughts; where it
makes no odds which way you face, whether you are
going or coming, whether it is morning or evening,
mid-noon or midnight; where earth is cheap enough
by being public; where you can walk and think with
least obstruction, there being nothing to measure progress
by; where you can pace when your breast is full,
and cherish your moodiness; where you are not in
false relations with men, are not dining nor conversing
with them; by which you may go to the uttermost
parts of the earth. It is wide enough, wide as the thoughts
it allows to visit you. Sometimes it is some particular
half-dozen rods which I wish to find myself pacing
over, as where certain airs blow; then my life will come
to me, methinks; like a hunter I walk in wait for it.
When I am against this bare promontory of a huckleberry
hill, then forsooth my thoughts will expand. Is
it some influence, as a vapor which exhales from the
ground, or something in the gales which blow there,
or in all things there brought together agreeably to
my spirit? The walls must not be too high, imprisoning
me, but low, with numerous gaps. The trees must
not be too numerous, nor the hills too near, bounding
the view, nor the soil too rich, attracting the attention
to the earth. It must simply be the way and the life,—a
way that was never known to be repaired, nor to need
repair, within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. I
cannot walk habitually in those ways that are liable to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
be mended; for sure it was the devil only that wore
them. Never by the heel of thinkers (of thought) were
they worn; the zephyrs could repair that damage. The
saunterer wears out no road, even though he travel on
it, and therefore should pay no highway, or rather <i>low</i>
way, tax. He may be taxed to construct a higher way
than men travel. A way which no geese defile, nor
hiss along it, but only sometimes their wild brethren
fly far overhead; which the kingbird and the swallow
twitter over, and the song sparrow sings on its rails;
where the small red butterfly is at home on the yarrow,
and no boys threaten it with imprisoning hat. There
I can walk and stalk and pace and plod. Which nobody
but Jonas Potter travels beside me; where no
cow but his is tempted to linger for the herbage by its
side; where the guide-board is fallen, and now the
hand points to heaven significantly,—to a Sudbury
and Marlborough in the skies. That’s a road I can
travel, that the particular Sudbury I am bound for,
six miles an hour, or two, as you please; and few there
be that enter thereon. There I can walk, and recover
the lost child that I am without any ringing of a bell;
where there was nothing ever discovered to detain a
traveller, but all went through about their business;
where I never passed the time of day with any,—indifferent
to me were the arbitrary divisions of time;
where Tullus Hostilius might have disappeared,—at
any rate has never been seen. The road to the Corner!
the ninety and nine acres that you go through to get
there! I would rather see it again, though I saw it this
morning, than Gray’s churchyard. The road whence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
you may hear a stake-driver, a whip-poor-will, a quail
in a midsummer day, a—yes, a quail comes nearest
to the <i>gum-c</i><a name='FA_240' id='FA_240' href='#FN_240' class='fnanchor'>[240]</a> bird heard there; where it would not be
sport for a sportsman to go. And the mayweed looks
up in my face,—not there; the pale lobelia, the Canada
snapdragon, rather. A little hardhack and meadowsweet
peep over the fence,—nothing more serious to
obstruct the view,—and thimble-berries are the food
of thought, before the drought, along by the walls.<a name='FA_241' id='FA_241' href='#FN_241' class='fnanchor'>[241]</a>
</p>

<p>
It is they who go to Brighton and to market that
wear out the roads, and they should pay all the tax.
The deliberate pace of a thinker never made a road
the worse for travelling on.
</p>

<p>
There I have freedom in my thought, and in my
soul am free. Excepting the omnipresent butcher with
his calf-cart, followed by a distracted and anxious
cow.<a name='FA_242' id='FA_242' href='#FN_242' class='fnanchor'>[242]</a>
</p>

<p>
Be it known that in Concord, where the first forcible
resistance to British aggression was made in the year
1775, they chop up the young calves and give them
to the hens to make them lay, it being considered the
cheapest and most profitable food for them, and they
sell the milk to Boston.
</p>

<p>
On the promenade deck of the world, an outside
passenger. The inattentive, ever strange baker, whom
no weather detains, that does not bake his bread in
this hemisphere,—and therefore it is dry before it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
gets here. Ah! there is a road where you might advertise
to fly, and make no preparations till the time
comes; where your wings will sprout if anywhere,
where your feet are not confined to earth. An airy head
makes light walking.
</p>

<p>
Where I am not confined and balked by the sight of
distant farmhouses which I have not gone past. In
roads the obstructions are not under my feet,—I care
not for rough ground or wet even,—but they are in my
vision and in the thoughts or associations which I am
compelled to entertain. I must be fancy-free; I must
feel that, wet or dry, high or low, it is the genuine surface
of the planet, and not a little chip-dirt or a compost-heap,
or made land or redeemed. Where I can sit
by the wall-side and not be peered at by any old ladies
going a-shopping, not have to bow to one whom I may
have seen in my youth,—at least, not more than once.
I am engaged and cannot be polite. Did you ever hear
of such a thing as a man sitting in the road, and then
have four eyes levelled at you? Have we any more
right sometimes to look at one than to point a revolver at
him; it might go off; and so, perchance, we might <i>see</i>
him,—though there is not so much danger of <i>that</i>,—which
would be equally fatal, if it <i>should</i> ever happen,
though perhaps it never has.
</p>

<p>
A thinker’s weight is in his thought, not in his tread;
when he thinks freely, his body weighs nothing. He
cannot tread down your grass, farmers.<a name='FA_243' id='FA_243' href='#FN_243' class='fnanchor'>[243]</a>
</p>

<p>
I thought to walk this forenoon instead of this afternoon,
for I have not been in the fields and woods much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
of late except when surveying, but the least affair of
that kind is as if you had [a] black veil drawn over your
face which shut out nature, as that eccentric and melancholy
minister whom I have heard of.<a name='FA_244' id='FA_244' href='#FN_244' class='fnanchor'>[244]</a> It may be the
fairest day in all the year and you shall not know it.
One little chore to do, one little commission to fulfill, one
message to carry, would spoil heaven itself. Talk about a
lover being engaged! He is the only man in all the world
who is free. And all you get is your dollars. To go
forth before the heat is intolerable, and see what is the
difference between forenoon and afternoon. It seems
there is a little more coolness in the air; there is still
some dew, even on this short grass in the shade of the
walls and woods; and a feeling of vigor the walker has.
There are few sounds but the slight twittering of swallows,
and the <i>springy</i> note of the sparrow in the grass
or trees, and a lark in the meadow (now at 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>),
and the cricket under all to ally the hour to night. Day
is, in fact, about as still as night. Draw the veil of night
over this landscape, and these sounds would not disturb
nor be inconsistent for their loudness with the night.
It is a difference of white and black. Nature is in a
white sleep. It threatens to be a hot day, and the haymakers
are whetting their scythes in the fields, where
they have been out since 4 o’clock. When I have seen
them in the twilight commencing their labors, I have
been impressed as if it were last night. There is something
ghastly about such very early labor. I cannot
detect the whole and characteristic difference between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
this and afternoon, though it is positive and decided
enough, as my instincts know. By 2 o’clock it will be
warmer and hazier, obscuring the mountains, and the
leaves will curl, and the dust will rise more readily.
Every herb is fresher now, has recovered from yesterday’s
drought. The cooler air of night still lingers in the
fields, as by night the warm air of day. The noon is
perchance the time to stay in the house.
</p>

<p>
There is no glory so bright but the veil of business
can hide it effectually. With most men life is postponed
to some trivial business, and so therefore is heaven.
Men think foolishly they may abuse and misspend life
as they please and when they get to heaven turn over a
new leaf.
</p>

<p>
I see the track of a bare human foot in the dusty road,
the toes and muscles all faithfully imprinted. Such a
sight is so rare that it affects me with surprise, as the
footprint on the shore of Juan Fernandez did Crusoe. It
is equally rare here. I am affected as if some Indian or
South-Sea-Islander had been along, some man who had
a foot. I am slow to be convinced that any of my neighbors—the
judge on the bench, the parson in the pulpit—might
have made that or something like it, however
irregular. It is pleasant as it is to see the tracks of cows
and deer and birds. I am brought so much nearer to
the tracker—when again I think of the sole of my own
foot—than when I behold that of his shoe merely, or
am introduced to him and converse with him in the
usual way. I am disposed to say to the judge whom I
meet, “Make tracks.”
</p>

<p>
Men are very generally spoiled by being so civil and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
well-disposed. You can have no profitable conversation
with them, they are so conciliatory, determined to
agree with you. They exhibit such long-suffering and
kindness in a short interview. I would meet with some
provoking strangeness, so that we may be guest and
host and refresh one another. It is possible for a man
wholly to disappear and be merged in his manners. The
thousand and one gentlemen whom I meet, I meet
despairingly and but to part from them, for I am not
cheered by the hope of any rudeness from them. A cross
man, a coarse man, an eccentric man, a silent, a man
who does not drill well,—of him there is some hope.
Your gentlemen, they are all alike. They utter their
opinions as if it was not a man that uttered them. It
is “just as you please;” they are indifferent to everything.
They will talk with you for nothing. The interesting
man will rather avoid [you], and it is a rare chance
if you get so far as talk with him. The laborers whom
I know, the loafers, fishers, and hunters, I can spin
yarns with profitably, for it is hands off; they are they
and I am I still; they do not come to me and quarter
themselves on me for a day or an hour to be treated
politely, they do not cast themselves on me for entertainment,
they do not approach me with a flag of truce.
They do not go out of themselves to meet me. I am
never electrified by my gentleman; he is not an electric
eel, but one of the common kind that slip through your
hands, however hard you clutch them, and leave them
covered with slime. He is a man, every inch of him;
is worth a groom.

<p>
To eat berries on the dry pastures of Conantum, as if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
they were the food of thought, dry as itself! Berries
are now thick enough to pick.
</p>

<p class="p2">
9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> On Conantum.—A quarter of a mile is distance
enough to make the atmosphere look blue now. This is
never the case in spring or early summer. It was fit
that I should see an indigo-bird here, concerned about its
young, a perfect embodiment of the darkest blue that
ever fills the valleys at this season. The meadow-grass
reflecting the light has a bluish cast also.
</p>

<p>
Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth; <i>i. e.</i>,
lay up a store of natural influences. Sing while you may,
before the evil days come. He that hath ears, let him
hear. See, hear, smell, taste, etc., while these senses
are fresh and pure.
</p>

<p>
There is always a kind of fine æolian harp music to be
heard in the air. I hear now, as it were, the mellow
sound of distant horns in the hollow mansions of the
upper air, a sound to make all men divinely insane
that hear it, far away overhead, subsiding into my ear.
To ears that are expanded what a harp this world is!
The occupied ear thinks that beyond the cricket no sound
can be heard, but there is an immortal melody that may
be heard morning, noon, and night, by ears that can
attend, and from time to time this man or that hears it,
having ears that were made for music. To hear this
the hardhack and the meadow-sweet <i>aspire</i>. They are
thus beautifully painted, because they are tinged in the
lower stratum of that melody.
</p>

<p>
I eat these berries as simply and naturally as thoughts
come to my mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Never yet did I chance to sit in a house, except my
own house in the woods, and hear a wood thrush sing.
Would it not be well to sit in such a chamber within
sound of the finest songster of the grove?
</p>

<p>
The quail, invisible, whistles, and who attends?
</p>

<p>
10 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—The white lily has opened. How could it
stand these heats? It has pantingly opened, and now lies
stretched out by its too long stem on the surface of the
shrunken river. The air grows more and more blue,
making pretty effects when one wood is seen from another
through a little interval. Some pigeons here are
resting in the thickest of the white pines during the
heat of the day, migrating, no doubt. They are unwilling
to move for me. Flies buzz and rain about my hat,
and the dead twigs and leaves of the white pine, which
the choppers have left here, exhale a dry and almost
sickening scent. A cuckoo chuckles, half throttled, on
a neighboring tree, and now, flying into the pine, scares
out a pigeon, which flies with its handsome tail spread,
dashes this side and that between the trees helplessly,
like a ship carrying too much sail in midst of a small
creek, some great amiral; having no room to manœuvre,—a
fluttering flight.
</p>

<p>
The mountains can scarcely be seen for the blue
haze,—only Wachusett and the near ones. The thorny
apple bush on Conantum has lately sent up branches
from its top, resolved to become a tree; and these
spreading (and bearing fruit), the whole has the form
of a vast hour-glass. The lower part being the most
dense by far, you would say the sand had run out.<a name='FA_245' id='FA_245' href='#FN_245' class='fnanchor'>[245]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I now return through Conant’s leafy woods by the
spring, whose floor is sprinkled with sunlight,—low
trees which yet effectually shade you.
</p>

<p>
The dusty mayweed now blooms by the roadside, one
of the humblest flowers. The rough hawkweed, too,
by the damp roadside, resembling in its flower the
autumnal dandelion. That was probably the <i>Verbena
hastata</i>, or common blue vervain, which I found the
other day by Walden Pond.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Antirrhinum Canadense</i>, Canada snapdragon, in
the Corner road; and the ragged orchis on Conantum.
</p>

<p class="p2">
8.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—The streets of the village are much more
interesting to me at this hour of a summer evening than
by day. Neighbors, and also farmers, come a-shopping
after their day’s haying, are chatting in the streets, and
I hear the sound of many musical instruments and of
singing from various houses. For a short hour or two
the inhabitants are sensibly employed. The evening is
devoted to poetry, such as the villagers can appreciate.
</p>

<p>
How rare to meet with a farmer who is a man of
sentiment! Yet there was one, Gen. Joshua Buttrick,
who died the other day, who is said to have lived in his
sentiments. He used to say that the smell of burning
powder excited him.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery
“to ascertain what degree of resolution was necessary
in order to place one’s self in formal opposition to the
most sacred laws of society.” He declared that “a
soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so
much courage as a foot-pad.” “Honor and religion have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
never stood in the way of a well-considered and a firm
resolve.<a name='FA_246' id='FA_246' href='#FN_246' class='fnanchor'>[246]</a> Tell me, Du Saillant, when you lead your
regiment into the heat of battle, to conquer a province
to which he whom you call your master has no right
whatever, do you consider that you are performing a
better action than mine, in stopping your friend on the
king’s highway, and demanding his purse?”
</p>

<p>
“I obey without reasoning,” replied the count.
</p>

<p>
“And I reason without obeying, when obedience
appears to me to be contrary to reason,” rejoined
Mirabeau.<a name='FA_247' id='FA_247' href='#FN_247' class='fnanchor'>[247]</a>
</p>

<p>
This was good and manly, as the world goes; and
yet it was desperate. A saner man would have found
opportunities enough to put himself in formal opposition
to the most sacred laws of society, and so test
his resolution, in the natural course of events, without
violating the laws of his own nature. It is not for a
man to <i>put himself</i> in such an attitude to society, but
to <i>maintain</i> himself in whatever attitude he finds himself
through obedience to the laws of his being, which
will never be one of opposition to a just government.<a name='FA_248' id='FA_248' href='#FN_248' class='fnanchor'>[248]</a>
Cut the leather only where the shoe pinches. Let us not
have a rabid virtue that will be revenged on society,—that
falls on it, not like the morning dew, but like the
fervid noonday sun, to wither it.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 22.</i> The season of morning fogs has arrived. I
think it is connected with dog-days. Perhaps it is owing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
to the greater contrast between the night and the day,
the nights being nearly as cold, while the days are
warmer? Before I rise from my couch, I see the ambrosial
fog stretched over the river, draping the trees.
It is the summer’s vapor bath. What purity in the color!
It is almost musical; it is positively fragrant. How
faery-like it has visited our fields. I am struck by its
firm outlines, as distinct as a pillow’s edge, about the
height of my house. A great crescent over the course of
the river from southwest to northeast. Already, 5.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,
some parts of the river are bare. It goes off in a body
down the river, before this air, and does not rise into
the heavens. It retreats, and I do not see how it is dissipated.
This slight, thin vapor which is left to curl
over the surface of the still, dark water, still as glass,
seems not [to] be the same thing,—of a different
quality. I hear the cockerels crow through it, and the
rich crow of young roosters, that sound indicative of
the bravest, rudest health, hoarse without cold, hoarse
with rude health. That crow is all-nature-compelling;
famine and pestilence flee before it. These are our
fairest days, which are born in a fog.
</p>

<p>
I saw the tall lettuce yesterday (<i>Lactuca elongata</i>),
whose top or main shoot had been broken off, and it
had put up various stems, with entire and lanceolate,
not runcinate leaves as usual, thus making what some
botanists have called a variety, <i>β. linearis</i>. So I have
met with some geniuses who, having met with some such
accident maiming them, have been developed in some
such <i>monstrous</i> and partial, though original, way. They
were original in being less than themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Yes, your leaf is peculiar, and some would make of
you a distinct variety, but to me you appear like the
puny result of an accident and misfortune, for you have
lost your main shoot, and the leaves which would have
grown runcinate are small and lanceolate.
</p>

<p>
The last Sunday afternoon I smelled the clear pork
frying for a farmer’s supper thirty rods off (what a
Sunday supper!), the windows being open, and could
imagine the <i>clear</i> tea without milk which usually accompanies
it.
</p>

<p>
Now the cat-o’-nine-tails are seen in the impenetrable
meadows, and the tall green rush is perfecting its tufts.
The spotted polygonum (<i>P. Persicaria</i>) by the roadside.
</p>

<p>
I scare up a woodcock from some moist place at
midday.
</p>

<p>
The pewee and kingbird are killing bees, perched on
a post or a dead twig.
</p>

<p>
I bathe me in the river. I lie down where it is shallow,
amid the weeds over its sandy bottom; but it seems
shrunken and parched; I find it difficult to get <i>wet</i>
through. I would fain be the channel of a mountain
brook. I bathe, and in a few hours I bathe again, not
remembering that I was wetted before. When I come
to the river, I take off my clothes and carry them over,
then bathe and wash off the mud and continue my
walk. I would fain take rivers in my walks endwise.
</p>

<p>
There was a singular charm for me in those French
names,—more than in the things themselves. The
names of Italian and Grecian cities, villages, and
natural features are not more poetic to me than the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
names of those humble Canadian villages. To be told
by a habitant, when I asked the name of a village in
sight, that is St. Féréol or St. Anne’s! But I was quite
taken off my feet when, running back to inquire what
river we were crossing, and thinking for a long time
he said <i>la rivière d’océan</i>, it flashed upon me at last
that it was <i>La Rivière du Chien</i>.<a name='FA_249' id='FA_249' href='#FN_249' class='fnanchor'>[249]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
There was so much grace and sentiment and refinement
in the names, how could they be coarse who took
them so often on their lips,—St. Anne’s, St. Joseph’s;
the holy Anne’s, the holy Joseph’s! Next to the Indian,
the French missionary and voyageur and Catholic
habitant have named the natural features of the land.
The <i>prairie</i>, the <i>voyageur</i>! Or does every man think
his neighbor is the richer and more fortunate man, his
neighbor’s fields the richest?
</p>

<p>
It needed only a little outlandishness in the names,
a little foreign accent, a few more vowels in the words,
to make me locate all my ideals at once. How prepared
we are for another world than this! We are no sooner
over the line of the States than we expect to see men
leading poetic lives,—nothing so natural, that is the
presumption. The names of the mountains, and the
streams, and the villages reel with the intoxication of
poetry—Longueuil, Chambly, Barthillon (?), Montilly (?).<a name='FA_250' id='FA_250' href='#FN_250' class='fnanchor'>[250]</a>
</p>

<p>
Where there were books only, to find realities. Of
course we assign to the place the idea which the written
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
history or poem suggested. Quebec, of course, is never
seen for what it simply is to practical eyes, but as the
local habitation of those thoughts and visions which
we have derived from reading of Wolfe and Montcalm,
Montgomery and Arnold. It is hard to make me attend
to the geology of Cape Diamond or the botany of the
Plains of Abraham.<a name='FA_251' id='FA_251' href='#FN_251' class='fnanchor'>[251]</a> How glad we are to find that there
is another race of men! for they may be more successful
and fortunate than we.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 23. Wednesday.</i> I remember the last moon,
shining through a creamy atmosphere, with a tear in
the eye of Nature and her tresses dishevelled and
drooping, sliding up the sky, the glistening air, the
leaves shining with dew, pulsating upward; an atmosphere
unworn, unprophaned by day. What self-healing
in Nature!—swept by the dews.
</p>

<p>
For some weeks past the roadsides and the dry and
trivial fields have been covered with the field trefoil
(<i>Trifolium arvense</i>), now in bloom.
</p>

<p class="p2">
8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—A comfortable breeze blowing. Methinks I
can write better in the afternoon, for the novelty of
it, if I should go abroad this morning. My genius
makes distinctions which my understanding cannot,
and which my senses do not report. If I should reverse
the usual,—go forth and saunter in the fields all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
forenoon, then sit down in my chamber in the afternoon,
which it is so unusual for me to do,—it would be like a
new season to me, and the novelty of it [would] inspire
me. The wind has fairly blown me outdoors; the elements
were so lively and active, and I so sympathized with
them, that I could not sit while the wind went by. And
I am reminded that we should especially improve the
summer to live out-of-doors. When we may so easily, it
behooves us to break up this custom of sitting in the
house, for it is but a custom, and I am not sure that it
has the sanction of common sense. A man no sooner
gets up than he sits down again. Fowls leave their
perch in the morning, and beasts their lairs, unless they
are such as go abroad only by night. The cockerel
does not take up a new perch <i>in the barn</i>, and he is the
embodiment of health and common sense. Is the literary
man to live always or chiefly sitting in a chamber
through which nature enters by a window only? What
is the use of the summer?
</p>

<p>
You must walk so gently as to hear the finest sounds,
the faculties being in repose. Your mind must not
perspire. True, out of doors my thought is commonly
drowned, as it were, and shrunken, pressed down by
stupendous piles of light ethereal influences, for the
pressure of the atmosphere is still fifteen pounds to a
square inch. I can do little more than preserve the
equilibrium and resist the pressure of the atmosphere.
I can only nod like the rye-heads in the breeze. I expand
more surely in my chamber, as far as expression
goes, as if that pressure were taken off; but here outdoors
is the place to store up influences.

<p>
The swallow’s twitter is the sound of the lapsing
waves of the air, or when they break and burst, as his
wings represent the ripple. He has more air in his bones
than other birds; his feet are defective. The fish of the
air. His note is the voice of the air. As fishes may hear
the sound of waves lapsing on the surface and see the
outlines of the ripples, so we hear the note and see

The influences which make for one walk more than
another, and one day more than another, are much
more ethereal than terrestrial. It is the quality of the
air much more than the quality of the ground that concerns
the walker,—cheers or depresses him. What
he may find in the air, not what he may find on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
On such a road (the Corner) I walk securely, seeing
far and wide on both sides, as if I were flanked by light
infantry on the hills, to rout the provincials, as the
British marched into Concord, while my grenadier
thoughts keep the main road. That is, my light-armed
and wandering thoughts scour the neighboring fields,
and so I know if the coast is clear. With what a breadth
of van I advance! I am not bounded by the walls. I
think more than the road full. (Going southwesterly.)
</p>

<p>
While I am abroad, the ovipositors plant their seeds
in me; I am fly-blown with thought, and go home to
hatch and brood over them.
</p>

<p>
I was too discursive and rambling in my thought for
the chamber, and must go where the wind blows on me
walking.
</p>

<p>
A little brook crossing the road (the Corner road),
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
a few inches’ depth of transparent water rippling over
yellow sand and pebbles, the pure blood of nature.
How miraculously crystal-like, how exquisite, fine, and
subtle, and liquid this element, which an imperceptible
inclination in the channel causes to flow thus surely
and swiftly! How obedient to its instinct, to the faintest
suggestion of the hills! If inclined but a hair’s breadth,
it is in a torrent haste to obey. And all the revolutions
of the planet—nature is so exquisitely adjusted—and
the attraction of the stars do not disturb this equipoise,
but the rills still flow the same way, and the water
levels are not disturbed.

We are not so much like debauchees as in the afternoon.

<p>
The mind is subject to moods, as the shadows of
clouds pass over the earth. Pay not too much heed to
them. Let not the traveller stop for them. They consist
with the fairest weather. By the mood of my mind,
I suddenly felt dissuaded from continuing my walk,
but I observed at the same instant that the shadow of
a cloud was passing over [the] spot on which I stood,
though it was of small extent, which, if it had no
connection with my mood, at any rate suggested how
transient and little to be regarded that mood was. I
kept on, and in a moment the sun shone on my walk
within and without.
</p>

<p>
The button-bush in blossom. The tobacco-pipe in
damp woods. Certain localities only a few rods square
in the fields and on the hills, sometimes the other side
of a wall, attract me as if they had been the scene of
pleasure in another state of existence.

But this habit of close observation,—in Humboldt,
Darwin, and others. Is it to be kept up long, this science?
Do not tread on the heels of your experience.
Be impressed without making a minute of it. Poetry
puts an interval between the impression and the expression,—waits
till the seed germinates naturally.

<i>July 24.</i> 5 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—The street and fields betray the
drought and look more parched than at noon; they
look as I feel,—languid and thin and feeling my nerves.
The potatoes and the elms and the herbage by the roadside,
though there is a slight dew, seem to rise out of an
arid and thirsty soil into the atmosphere of a furnace
slightly cooled down. The leaves of the elms are yellow.
Ah! now I see what the noon was and what it may be
again. The effects of drought are never more apparent
than at dawn. Nature is like a hen panting with open
mouth, in the grass, as the morning after a debauch.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 25. Friday.</i> Started for Clark’s Island at
7 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>
</p>

<p>
At 9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> took the Hingham boat and was landed
at Hull. There was a pleasure party on board, apparently
boys and girls belonging to the South End, going
to Hingham. There was a large proportion of ill-dressed
and ill-mannered boys of Irish extraction. A sad
sight to behold! Little boys of twelve years, prematurely
old, sucking cigars! I felt that if I were their mothers
I should whip them and send them to bed. Such children
should be dealt with as for stealing or impurity.
The opening of this valve for the safety of the city!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
Oh, what a wretched resource! What right have parents
to beget, to bring up, and attempt to <i>educate</i> children in
a city? I thought of infanticide among the Orientals
with complacency. I seemed to hear infant voices lisp,
“Give us a fair chance, parents.” There is no such
squalidness in the country. You would have said that
they must all have come from the house of correction
and the farm-school, but such a company do the boys
in Boston streets make. The birds have more care for
their young,—where they place their nests. What
are a city’s charities? She cannot be charitable any
more than the old philosopher could move the earth,
unless she has a resting-place without herself. A true
culture is more possible to the savage than to the boy
of average intellect, born of average parents, in a great
city. I believe that they perish miserably. How can
they be kept clean, physically or morally? It is folly
to attempt to educate children within a city; the first
step must be to remove them out of it. It seemed a
groping and helpless philanthropy that I heard of.
</p>

<p>
I heard a boy telling the story of Nix’s Mate to some
girls, as we passed that spot, how “he said, ‘If I am
guilty, this island will remain; but if I am innocent, it
will be washed away,’ and now it is all washed away.”<a name='FA_253' id='FA_253' href='#FN_253' class='fnanchor'>[253]</a>
This was a simple and strong expression of feeling
suitable to the occasion, by which he committed the
evidence of his innocence to the dumb isle, such as the
boy could appreciate, a proper sailor’s legend; and I
was reminded that it is the illiterate and unimaginative
class that seizes on and transmits the legends in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
the more cultivated delight. No fastidious poet dwelling
in Boston had tampered with it,—no narrow poet,
but broad mankind, sailors from all ports sailing by.
They, sitting on the deck, were the literary academy
that sat upon its periods.
</p>

<p>
On the beach at Hull, and afterwards all along the
shore to Plymouth, I saw the datura, the variety (red-stemmed),
methinks, which some call <i>Tatula</i> instead
of <i>Stramonium</i>. I felt as if I was on the highway of the
world, at sight of this cosmopolite and veteran traveller.
It told of commerce and sailors’ yarns without end. It
grows luxuriantly in sand and gravel. This Captain
Cook among plants, this Norseman or sea pirate,
viking or king of the bays, the beaches. It is not an innocent
plant; it suggests commerce, with its attendant
vices.<a name='FA_254' id='FA_254' href='#FN_254' class='fnanchor'>[254]</a>
</p>

<p>
Saw a public house where I landed at Hull, made
like some barns which I have seen, of boards with a
cleat nailed over the cracks, without clapboards or
paint, evidently very simple and cheap, yet neat and
convenient as well as airy. It interested me, as the New
House at Long Island did not, as it brought the luxury
and comfort of the seashore within reach of the less
wealthy. It was such an exhibition of good sense as I
was not prepared for and do not remember to have seen
before. Ascended to the top of the hill, where is the old
French fort, with the well said to be ninety feet deep,
now covered.<a name='FA_255' id='FA_255' href='#FN_255' class='fnanchor'>[255]</a> I saw some horses standing on the very
top of the ramparts, the highest part of Hull, where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
there was hardly room to turn round, for the sake of the
breeze.<a name='FA_256' id='FA_256' href='#FN_256' class='fnanchor'>[256]</a> It was excessively warm, and their instincts,
or their experience perchance, guided them as surely
to the summit as it did me. Here is the telegraph, nine
miles from Boston, whose State-House was just visible,—movable
signs on a pole with holes in them for the
passage of the wind. A man about the telegraph station
thought it the highest point in the harbor; said they
could tell the kind of vessel thirty miles off, the number
at masthead ten or twelve miles, name on hull six
or seven miles. They can see furthest in the fall. There
is a mist summer and winter, when the contrast between
the temperature of the sea and the air is greatest. I did
not see why this hill should not be fortified as well as
George’s Island, it being higher and also commanding
the main channel. However, an enemy could go by all
the forts in the dark, as Wolfe did at Quebec.<a name='FA_257' id='FA_257' href='#FN_257' class='fnanchor'>[257]</a> They
are bungling contrivances.
</p>

<p>
Here the bank is rapidly washing away. On every
side, in Boston Harbor, the evidences of the wasting
away of the islands are so obvious and striking that
they appear to be wasting faster than they are. You
will sometimes see a springing hill, showing by the
interrupted arch of its surface against the sky how
much space [it] must have occupied where there is
now water, as at Point Allerton,—what botanists
call premorse. <img src="images/i-379.jpg" width="120" height="34" alt="Hull" /> Hull looks as if it had
been two islands, since connected
by a beach. I was struck by the gracefully curving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
and fantastic shore of a small island (Hog Island)
inside of Hull, <img src="images/i-380.jpg" width="96" height="97" alt="Island" /> where everything seemed to
be gently lapsing into futurity, as if the
inhabitants should bear a ripple <img src="images/i-380b.jpg" width="26" height="40" alt="Ripple" />
for device on their coat-of-arms, a
wave passing over them, with the datura growing on
their shores. The wrecks of isles fancifully arranged
into a new shore. To see the sea nibbling thus voraciously
at the continents!<a name='FA_258' id='FA_258' href='#FN_258' class='fnanchor'>[258]</a> A man at the telegraph told
me of a white oak pole a foot and a half in diameter,
forty feet high, and four feet or more in the rock at
Minot’s Ledge, with four guys, which stood only one
year. Stone piled up cob-fashion near same place
stood eight years.
</p>

<p>
Hull pretty good land, but bare of trees—only a
few cherries for the most part—and mostly uncultivated,
being owned by few. I heard the voices of men
shouting aboard a vessel half a mile from the shore,
which sounded as if they were in a barn in the country,
they being between the sails. It was not a sea sound.
It was a purely rural sound.<a name='FA_259' id='FA_259' href='#FN_259' class='fnanchor'>[259]</a>
</p>

<p>
Man needs to know but little more than a lobster in
order to catch him in his traps. Here were many lobster
traps on the shore. The beds of dry seaweed or
eel-grass on the beach remind me of narrow shavings.
On the farther hill in Hull, I saw a field full of Canada
thistles close up to the fences on all sides, while beyond
them there was none. So much for these fields
having been subjected to different culture. So a different
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
culture in the case of men brings in different weeds.
As are the virtues, so are the vices. Weeds come in with
the seeds, though perhaps much more in the manure.
Each kind of culture will introduce its own weeds.
</p>

<p>
I am bothered to walk with those who wish to keep
step with me. It is not necessary to keep step with your
companion, as some endeavor to do.
</p>

<p>
They told me at Hull that they burned the <i>stem</i> of
the kelp chiefly for potash. Chemistry is not a splitting
hairs when you have got half a dozen raw Irishmen
in the laboratory.
</p>

<p>
As I walked on the beach (Nantasket), panting with
thirst, a man pointed to a white spot on the side of a
distant hill (Strawberry Hill he called it) which rose
from the gravelly beach, and said that there was a pure
and cold and unfailing spring; and I could not help
admiring that in this town of Hull, of which I had
heard, but now for the first time saw, a single spring
should appear to me and should be of so much value.
I found Hull indeed, but there was also a spring on
that parched, unsheltered shore; the spring, though I
did not visit it, made the deepest impression on my
mind. Hull, the place of the spring and of the well.
This is what the traveller would remember. All that
he remembered of Rome was a spring on the Capitoline
Hill!<a name='FA_260' id='FA_260' href='#FN_260' class='fnanchor'>[260]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
It is the most perfect seashore I have seen.<a name='FA_261' id='FA_261' href='#FN_261' class='fnanchor'>[261]</a> The
rockweed falls over you like the <i>tresses</i> of mermaids,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
and you see the propriety of that epithet. You cannot
swim among these weeds and pull yourself up by them
without thinking of mermen and mermaids.
</p>

<p>
The barnacles on the rocks, which make a whitish
strip a few feet in width just above the weeds, remind
me of some vegetable growth which I have seen,—surrounded
by a circle of calyx-like or petal-like shells
like some buds or seed-vessels. They, too, clinging to
the rocks like the weeds; lying along the seams of the
rock like buttons on a waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
I saw in Cohasset, separated from the sea only by a
narrow beach, a very large and handsome but shallow
lake, of at least four hundred acres, with five rocky islets
in it; which the sea had tossed over the beach in the
great storm in the spring, and, after the alewives had
passed into it, stopped up its outlet; and now the alewives
were dying by thousands, and the inhabitants
apprehended a pestilence as the water evaporated. The
water was very foul.<a name='FA_262' id='FA_262' href='#FN_262' class='fnanchor'>[262]</a>
</p>

<p>
The rockweed is considered the best for manure.
I saw them drying the Irish moss in quantities at Jerusalem
Village in Cohasset. It is said to be used for sizing
calico. Finding myself on the edge of a thunder-storm,
I stopped a few moments at the Rock House in Cohasset,
close to the shore. There was scarcely rain
enough to wet one, and no wind. I was therefore surprised
to hear afterward, through a young man who
had just returned from Liverpool, that there was a
severe squall at quarantine ground, only seven or eight
miles northwest of me, such as he had not experienced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
for three years, which sunk several boats and caused
some vessels to drag their anchors and come near going
ashore; proving that the gust which struck the water
there must have been of very limited breadth, for I
was or might have been overlooking the spot and felt
no wind. This rocky shore is called Pleasant Cove on
large maps; on the map of Cohasset alone, the name
seems to be confined to the cove where I first saw the
wreck of the St. John alone.<a name='FA_263' id='FA_263' href='#FN_263' class='fnanchor'>[263]</a>
</p>

<p>
Brush Island, opposite this, with a hut on it, not
permanently inhabited. It takes but little soil to tempt
men to inhabit such places. I saw here the American
holly (<i>Ilex opaca</i>), which is not found further north
than Massachusetts, but south and west. The yellow
gerardia in the woods.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 26.</i> At Cohasset.—Called on Captain Snow,
who remembered hearing fishermen say that they
“fitted out at Thoreau’s;” remembered him. He had
commanded a packet between Boston or New York
and England. Spoke of the wave which he sometimes
met on the Atlantic coming against the wind, and which
indicated that the wind was blowing from an opposite
quarter at a distance, the undulation travelling faster
than the wind. They see Cape Cod loom here. Thought
the Bay between here and Cape Ann thirty fathoms
deep; between here and Cape Cod, sixty or seventy
fathoms. The “Annual of Scientific Discovery” for
1851 says, quoting a Mr. A. G. Findley, “Waves travel
very great distances, and are often raised by distant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
hurricanes, having been felt simultaneously at St.
Helena and Ascension, though 600 miles apart, and
it is probable that ground swells often originate at
the Cape of Good Hope, 3000 miles distant.” Sailors
tell of tide-rips. Some are thought to be occasioned by
earthquakes.
</p>

<p>
The ocean at Cohasset did not look as if any were ever
shipwrecked in it. Not a vestige of a wreck left. It was
not grand and sublime now, but beautiful. The water
held in the little hollows of the rocks, on the receding
of the tide, is so crystal-pure that you cannot believe
it salt, but wish to drink it.<a name='FA_264' id='FA_264' href='#FN_264' class='fnanchor'>[264]</a>
</p>

<p>
The architect of a Minot Rock lighthouse might
profitably spend a day studying the worn rocks of
Cohasset shore, and learn the power of the waves, see
what kind of sand the sea is using to grind them down.
</p>

<p>
A fine delicate seaweed, which some properly enough
call sea-green. Saw here the staghorn, or velvet,
sumach (<i>Rhus typhina</i>), so called from form of young
branches, a size larger than the <i>Rhus glabra</i> common
with us. The <i>Plantago maritima</i>, or sea plantain, properly
named. I guessed its name before I knew what
it was called by botanists. The American sea-rocket
(<i>Bunias edentula</i>) I suppose it was that I saw,—the succulent
plant with much cut leaves and small pinkish (?)
flowers.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 27. Sunday.</i> Walked from Cohasset to Duxbury
and sailed thence to Clark’s Island.
</p>

<p>
Visited the large tupelo tree (<i>Nyssa multiflora</i>) in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
Scituate, whose rounded and open top, like some umbelliferous
plant’s, I could see from Mr. Sewal’s, the
tree which George Emerson went twenty-five miles to
see, called sometimes snag-tree and swamp hornbeam,
also pepperidge and gum-tree. Hard to split. We have
it in Concord. Cardinal-flower in bloom. Scituate
meeting-houses on very high ground; the principal one
a landmark for sailors. Saw the buckthorn, which is
naturalized. One of Marshfield meeting-houses on the
height of land on my road. The country generally descends
westerly toward the sources of Taunton River.
</p>

<p>
After taking the road by Webster’s beyond South
Marshfield, I walked a long way at noon, hot and
thirsty, before I could find a suitable place to sit and
eat my dinner,—a place where the shade and the
sward pleased me. At length I was obliged to put up
with a small shade close to the ruts, where the only
stream I had seen for some time crossed the road. Here,
also, numerous robins came to cool and wash themselves
and to drink. They stood in the water up to their
bellies, from time to time wetting their wings and tails
and also ducking their heads and sprinkling the water
over themselves; then they sat on a fence near by to dry.
Then a goldfinch came and did the same, accompanied
by the less brilliant female. These birds evidently
enjoyed their bath greatly, and it seemed indispensable
to them.
</p>

<p>
A neighbor of Webster’s told me that he had hard
on to sixteen hundred acres and was still buying more,—a
farm and factory within the year; cultivated a
hundred and fifty acres. I saw twelve acres of potatoes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
together, the same of rye and wheat, and more methinks
of buckwheat. Fifteen or sixteen men, Irish
mostly, at ten dollars a month, doing the work of fifty,
with a Yankee overseer, long a resident of Marshfield,
named Wright. Would eat only the produce of his
farm during the few weeks he was at home,—brown
bread and butter and milk,—and sent out for a pig’s
cheek to eat with his greens. Ate only what grew on
his farm, but drank more than ran on his farm.
</p>

<p>
Took refuge from the rain at a Mr. Stetson’s in
Duxbury.
</p>

<p>
I forgot to say that I passed the Winslow House, now
belonging to Webster. This land was granted to the
family in 1637.
</p>

<p>
Sailed with tavern-keeper Winsor, who was going
out mackereling. Seven men, stripping up their clothes,
each bearing an armful of wood and one some new
potatoes, walked to the boats, then shoved them out a
dozen rods over the mud, then rowed half a mile to the
schooner of forty-three tons. They expected [to] be
gone about a week, and to begin to fish perhaps the
next morning. Fresh mackerel which they carried to
Boston. Had four dories, and commonly fished from
them. Else they fished on the starboard side aft, where
their lines hung ready with the old baits on, two to a
man. I had the experience of going on a mackerel
cruise.
</p>

<p>
They went aboard their schooner in a leisurely way
this Sunday evening, with a fair but very slight wind,
the sun now setting clear and shining on the vessel after
several thunder-showers. I was struck by the small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
quantity of supplies which they appeared to take. We
climbed aboard, and there we were in a mackerel
schooner. The baits were not dry on the hooks. Winsor
cast overboard the foul juice of mackerels mixed with
rain-water which remained in his trough. There was
the mill in which to grind up the mackerel for bait, and
the trough to hold it, and the long-handled dipper to
cast it overboard with; and already in the harbor we
saw the surface rippled with schools of small mackerel.
They proceeded leisurely to weigh anchor, and then to
raise their two sails. There was one passenger, going
for health or amusement, who had been to California.
I had the experience of going a-mackereling, though I
was landed on an island before we got out of the harbor.
They expected to commence fishing the next morning.
It had been a very warm day with frequent thunder-showers.
I had walked from Cohasset to Duxbury, and
had walked about the latter town to find a passage to
Clark’s Island, about three miles distant, but no boat
could stir, they said, at that state of the tide.<a name='FA_265' id='FA_265' href='#FN_265' class='fnanchor'>[265]</a> The
tide was down, and boats were left high and dry. At
length I was directed to Winsor’s tavern, where perchance
I might find some mackerel-fishers, who were
going to sail that night to be ready for fishing in the
morning, and, as they would pass near the island, they
would take me. I found it so. Winsor himself was
going. I told him he was the very man for me; but I
must wait an hour. So I ate supper with them. Then
one after another of his crew was seen straggling to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
shore, for the most part in high boots,—some made
of india-rubber,—some with their pants stripped up.
There were seven for this schooner, beside a passenger
and myself. The leisurely manner in which they proceeded
struck me. I had taken off my shoes and stockings
and prepared to wade. Each of the seven took an
armful of pine wood and walked with it to the two boats,
which lay at high-water mark in the mud; then they
resolved that each should bring one more armful and
that would be enough. They had already got a barrel
of water and had some more in the schooner, also a
bucket of new potatoes. Then, dividing into two parties,
we pulled and shoved the boats a dozen rods over
the mud and water till they floated, then rowed half a
mile or more over the shallow water to the little schooner
and climbed aboard. Many seals had their heads out.
We gathered about the helmsman and talked about the
compass, which was affected by the iron in the vessel,
etc., etc.<a name='FA_266' id='FA_266' href='#FN_266' class='fnanchor'>[266]</a>

<p class="p2">
Clark’s Island, Sunday night.—On Friday night
December 8th, O. S., the Pilgrims, exploring in the shallop,
landed on Clark’s Island (so called from the master’s
mate of the May-Flower), where they spent three
nights and kept their first Sabbath. On Monday, or
the 11th, O. S., they landed on the Rock. This island
contains about eighty-six acres and was once covered
with red cedars which were sold at Boston for gate-posts.
I saw a few left, one, two feet in diameter at the ground,
which was probably standing when the Pilgrims came.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
Ed. Watson, who could remember them nearly fifty
years, had observed but little change in them. Hutchinson
calls this one of the best islands in Massachusetts
Bay. The town kept it at first as a sacred place, but
finally sold it in 1690 to Samuel Lucas, Elkanah Watson,
and George Morton. Saw a stag’s-horn sumach five
or six inches in diameter and eighteen feet high. Here
was the marsh goldenrod (<i>Solidago lævigata</i>) not yet in
blossom; a small bluish flower in the marshes, which
they called rosemary; a kind of chenopodium which
appeared distinct from the common; and a short
oval-leaved, set-looking plant which I suppose is <i>Glaux

Skates’ eggs, called in England skate-barrows
from their form, on the sand. The old cedars
were flat-topped, spreading, the stratum of the wind
drawn out.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 28. Monday morning.</i> Sailed [to] the Gurnet,
which runs down seven miles into the bay from Marshfield.
Heard the <i>peep</i> of the <i>beach-bird</i>. Saw some ring-necks
in company with peeps. They told of eagles
which had flown low over the island lately. Went by
Saquish. Gathered a basketful of Irish moss bleached
on the beach. Saw a field full of pink-blossomed potatoes
at the lighthouse, remarkably luxuriant and full
of blossoms; also some French barley. Old fort and
barracks by lighthouse. Visited lobster houses or huts
there, where they use lobsters to catch bait for lobsters.
Saw on the shanties signs from ships, as “Justice Story”
and “Margueritta.” To obtain bait is sometimes the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
main thing. Samphire (<i>Salicornia</i>), which they pickle;
also a kind of prickly samphire, which I suppose is
saltwort, or <i>Salsola Caroliniana</i>. Well at Clark’s Island
twenty-seven and three quarters feet deep. Cut the rockweed
on the rocks at low tide once in two or three years.
Very valuable; more than they have time to save.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Ned told of a man who went off fishing from
back of Wellfleet in calm weather, and with great
difficulty got ashore through the surf. Those in the
other boat, who had landed, were unwilling to take
the responsibility of telling them when to pull for shore;
the one who had the helm was inexperienced. They were
swamped at once. So treacherous is this shore. Before
the wind comes, perchance, the sea may run so as to
upset and drown you on the shore. At first they thought
to pull for Provincetown, but night was coming on, and
that was distant many a long mile. Their case was a
desperate one. When they came near the shore and
saw the terrific breakers that intervened, they were
deterred. They were thoroughly frightened.<a name='FA_267' id='FA_267' href='#FN_267' class='fnanchor'>[267]</a>
</p>

<p>
Were troubled with skunks on this island; they must
have come over on the ice. Foxes they had seen; had
killed one woodchuck; even a large <i>mud turtle</i>, which
they <i>conjectured some bird must have dropped</i>. Muskrats
they had seen, and killed two raccoons once. I went
a-clamming just before night. This the clam-digger,
borrowed of Uncle Bill (Watson) in his schooner
home. The clams nearly a foot deep, but I broke <img src="images/i-390.jpg" width="47" height="95" alt="Shovel" />
many in digging. Said not to be good now, but
we found them good eaten fresh. No sale for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
them now; fetch twenty-five cents a bucket in their
season. Barry caught squids as bait for bass. We found
many dead clams,—their shells full of sand,—called
sand clams.<a name='FA_268' id='FA_268' href='#FN_268' class='fnanchor'>[268]</a> By a new clam law any one can dig clams
here. Brown’s Island, so called, a shoal off the Gurnet,
thought to have been an isle once, a dangerous place.
<img src="images/i-391.jpg" width="110" height="48" alt="Fences" /> Saw here fences, the posts set in cross
sleepers, made to be removed in winter.
</p>

<p>
The finest music in a menagerie, its wildest strains,
have something in them akin to the cries of the tigers
and leopards heard in their native forests. Those strains
are not unfitted to the assemblage of wild beasts. They
express to my ear what the tiger’s stripes and the
leopard’s spots express to my eye; and they appear to
grin with satisfaction at the sound. That nature has
any place at all for music is very good.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 29. Tuesday.</i> A northeast wind with rain, but
the sea is the wilder for it. I heard the surf roar on the
Gurnet [in] the night, which, as Uncle Ned and Freeman
said, showed that the wind would work round east and
we should have rainy weather. It was the wave reaching
the shore before the wind. The ocean was heaped up
somewhere to the eastward, and this roar was occasioned
by its effort to preserve its equilibrium. The rut of the
sea.<a name='FA_269' id='FA_269' href='#FN_269' class='fnanchor'>[269]</a> In the afternoon I sailed to Plymouth, three miles,
notwithstanding the drizzling rain, or “drisk,” as Uncle
Ned called it. We passed round the head of Plymouth
beach, which is three miles long. I did not know till
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
afterward that I had landed where the Pilgrims did and
passed over the Rock on Hedge’s Wharf. Returning,
we had more wind and tacking to do.
</p>

<p>
Saw many seals together on a flat. Singular that these
strange animals should be so abundant here and yet
the man who lives a few miles inland never hear of
them. To him there is no report of the sea, though he
may read the Plymouth paper. The Boston papers
do not tell us that they have seals in the Harbor. The
inhabitants of Plymouth do not seem to be aware of it.
I always think of seals in connection with Esquimaux
or some other outlandish people, not in connection with
those who live on the shores of Boston and Plymouth
harbors. Yet from their windows they may daily see a
family [of] seals, the real <i>Phoca vitulina</i>, collected on
a flat or sporting in the waves. I saw one dashing
through the waves just ahead of our boat, going to join
his companions on the bar,—as strange to me as the
merman. No less wild, essentially, than when the Pilgrims
came is this harbor.
</p>

<p>
It being low tide, we landed on a flat which makes
out from Clark’s Island, to while away the time, not
being able to get quite up yet. I found numerous <i>large</i>
holes of the sea clam in this sand (no small clams), and
dug them out easily and rapidly with my hands. Could
have got a large quantity in a short time; but here they
do not eat them; think they will make you sick. They
were not so deep in the sand, not more than five or six
inches. I saw where one had squirted full ten feet before
the wind, as appeared by the marks of the drops
on the sand. Some small ones I found not more than a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
quarter of an inch in length. Le Baron brought me [a]
round clam or quahog alive, with a very thick shell, and
not so nearly an isosceles triangle as the sea clam,—more
like this: <img src="images/i-393.jpg" width="126" height="52" alt="Clams" /> with a protuberance on
the back. The sea clam: <img src="images/i-393b.jpg" width="80" height="23" alt="Clams" /> A small, narrow
clam <img src="images/i-393c.jpg" width="107" height="59" alt="Clams" /> which they called the
bank clam; also crab-cases, handsomely spotted. Small
crab always in a cockle-shell if not in a case of his own.
A cockle as large as my fist. Mussels, small ones,
empty shells; an extensive bank where they had died.
Occasionally a large deep-sea mussel, which some kelp
had brought up. We caught some sand eels seven or
eight inches long,—<i>Ammodytes tobianus</i>, according to
Storer, and not the <i>A. lancea</i> of Yarrell, though the size
of the last comes nearer. They were in the shallow pools
left on the sand (the flat was here pure naked yellowish
sand), and quickly buried themselves when pursued.
They are used as bait for bass. Found some sand-circles
or sandpaper, like top of a stone jug cut off, with a large
nose; said to be made by the foot of the large cockle,
which has some glutinous matter on it.<a name='FA_270' id='FA_270' href='#FN_270' class='fnanchor'>[270]</a> A circle of sand
about as thick as thick pasteboard. It reminded me of
the caddis-worm cases, skate-barrows, etc., etc. I observed
the shell of a sea clam one valve of which was
filled exactly even full with sand,—evenly as if it had
been heaped and then scraped off, as when men measure
by the peck. This was a fresher one of the myriad
sand-clams, and it suggested to me how the stone clams
which I had seen on Cape Cod might have been formed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
Perchance a clamshell was the mould in which they were
cast, and a slight hardening of the level surface, before
the whole is turned to stone, causes them to split in two.
The sand was full of stone clams in the mould.<a name='FA_271' id='FA_271' href='#FN_271' class='fnanchor'>[271]</a> I saw
the kelp attached to stones half as big as my head,
which it had transported. I do not think I ever saw the
kelp <i>in situ</i>. Also attached to a deep-sea mussel. The
kelp is like a broad ruffled belt. The middle portion is
thicker and flat, the edges for two or three inches thinner
and fuller, so that it is fulled or ruffled, as if the edges
had been hammered. The extremity is generally worn
and ragged from the lashing of the waves. It is the
prototype of a fringed belt. Uncle Ned said that the
cows ate it.<a name='FA_272' id='FA_272' href='#FN_272' class='fnanchor'>[272]</a> We saw in the shallow water a long, <i>round</i>
green grass, six or eight feet long, clogging up the channel.
Round grass, I think they called it. We caught a
lobster, as you might catch a mud turtle in the country,
in the shallow water, pushing him ashore with the paddle,
taking hold of his tail to avoid being bitten. They
are obliged to put wooden plugs or wedges beside their
claws to prevent their tearing each other to pieces. All
weeds are bleached on the beach.
</p>

<p>
This sailing on salt water was something new to me.
The boat is such a living creature, even this clumsy
one sailing within five points of the wind. The sailboat
is an admirable invention, by which you compel the
wind to transport you even against itself. It is easier to
guide than a horse; the slightest pressure on the tiller
suffices. I think the inventor must have been greatly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
surprised, as well as delighted, at the success of his
experiment. It is so contrary to expectation, as if the
elements were disposed to favor you. This deep, unfordable
sea! but this wind ever blowing over it to
transport you! At 10 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> it was perfectly fair and bright
starlight.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>July 30. Wednesday.</i> The house here stands within
a grove of balm-of-Gileads, horse-chestnuts, cherries,
apples, and plums, etc. Uncle Bill, who lives in his
schooner,—not turned up Numidian fashion, but anchored
in the mud,—whom I meant to call on yesterday
morn, lo! had run over to “the Pines” last evening,
fearing an easterly storm. He outrode the great gale in
the spring alone in the harbor, dashing about. He goes
after rockweed, lighters vessels, and saves wrecks. Now
I see him lying in the mud over at the Pines in the horizon,
which place he cannot leave if he will, till flood-tide;
but he will not, it seems. This waiting for the tide is a
singular feature in the life by the shore. In leaving your
boat to-day you must always have reference to what you
are going to do the next day. A frequent answer is, “Well,
you can’t start for two hours yet.” It is something new
to a landsman, and at first he is not disposed to wait.<a name='FA_273' id='FA_273' href='#FN_273' class='fnanchor'>[273]</a>
I saw some heaps of shells left by the Indians near the
northern end of the island. They were a rod in diameter
and a foot or more high in the middle, and covered with
a shorter and greener grass than the surrounding field.
Found one imperfect arrowhead.
</p>

<p>
At 10 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> sailed to Webster’s, past Powder Point in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
Duxbury. We could see his land from the island. I was
steersman and learned the meaning of some nautical
phrases,—“luff,” to keep the boat close to the wind
till the sails begin to flap; “bear away,” to put the sail
more at right angles with the wind; a “close haul,”
when the sails are brought and belayed nearly or quite
in a line with the vessel. On the marshes we saw
patches of a “<i>black</i> grass.” A large field of wheat at
Webster’s,—half a dozen acres at least,—many apple
trees, three-thorned acacias, tulip-trees; cranberry
experiment; seaweed spread under his tomatoes. Wild
geese with black and gray heads and necks, not so
heavy and clumsy as the tame Bremens. Large, noisy
Hongkong geese. Handsome calves. Three thousand (?)
acres of marsh.
</p>

<p>
Talked with Webster’s nearest neighbor, Captain
Hewit, whose small farm he surrounds and endeavors
in vain to buy. A fair specimen of a retired Yankee
sea-captain turned farmer. Proud of the quantity of
carrots he had raised on a small patch. It was better
husbandry than Webster’s. He told a story of his buying
a cargo for his owners at St. Petersburg just as peace
was declared in the last war. These men are not so remarkable
for anything as the quality of hardness. The
very fixedness and rigidity of their jaws and necks
express a sort of adamantine hardness. This is what
they have learned by contact with the elements. The
man who does not grow rigid with years and experience!
Where is he? What avails it to grow hard merely?
The harder you are, the more brittle really, like the
bones of the old. How much rarer and better to grow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
mellow! A sort of stone fruit the man bears commonly;
a bare stone it is, without any sweet and mellow pericarp
around it. It is like the peach which has dried to
the stone as the season advanced; it is dwindled to a
dry stone with its almond. In presence of one of these
hard men I think: “How brittle! How easily you would
crack! What a poor and lame conclusion!” I can think
of nothing but a stone in his head. Truly genial men
do not grow [hard]. It is the result of despair, this attitude
of resistance. They behave like men already
driven to the wall. Notwithstanding that the speaker
trembles with infirmity while he speaks,—his hand on
the spade,—it is such a trembling as betrays a stony
nature. His hand trembles so that the full glass of
cider which he prizes to a drop will have lost half its contents
before it reaches his lips, as if a tempest had arisen
in it. Hopelessly hard. But there is another view of
him. He is somebody. He has an opinion to express,
if you will wait to hear him. A certain manliness and
refreshing resistance is in him. He generally makes
Webster a call, but Webster does not want to see you
more than twenty minutes. It does not take him long to
say all he has got to say. He had not seen him to speak
to him since he had come home this time. He had sent
him over a couple of fine cod the night before. Such
a man as Hewit sees not finely but coarsely.

<p class="p2">
<i>July 31. Thursday.</i> Those same round shells (<i>Scutella
parma</i> (<i>placenta</i>) ?) on the sand as at Cape Cod, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363' href='#Page_363'>363</a></span>
live ones reddish, the dead white. Went off early this
morning with Uncle Ned to catch bass with the small
fish I had found on the sand the night before. Two of
his neighbor Albert Watson’s boys were there,—not
James, the oldest, but Edward, the sailor, and Mortimer
(or Mort),—in their boat. They killed some
striped bass (<i>Labrax lineatus</i>) with paddles in a shallow
creek in the sand, and caught some lobsters. I remarked
that the seashore was singularly clean, for, notwithstanding
the spattering of the water and mud and
squirting of the clams and wading to and fro the boat,
my best black pants retained no stains nor dirt, as they
would acquire from walking in the country. I caught
a bass with a young—haik? (perchance), trailing
thirty feet behind while Uncle Ned paddled. They
catch them in England with a “trawl-net.” Sometimes
they weigh seventy-five pounds here.
</p>

<p>
At 11 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> set sail to Plymouth. We went somewhat
out of a direct course, to take advantage of the tide,
which was coming in. Saw the site of the first house,
which was burned, on Leyden Street. Walked up the
same, parallel with the Town Brook. Hill from which
Billington Sea was discovered hardly a mile from the
shore, on Watson’s grounds. Watson’s Hill, where
treaty was made across brook south of Burying Hill.
At Watson’s,<a name='FA_274' id='FA_274' href='#FN_274' class='fnanchor'>[274]</a> the oriental plane, <i>Abies Douglasii</i>,
ginkgo tree (<i>q. v.</i> on Common), a foreign hardhack,
English oak (dark-colored, small leaf), Spanish chestnut,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
Chinese arbor-vitæ, Norway spruce (like our fir
balsam), a new kind of fir balsam. Black eagle one of
the good cherries. Fuchsias in hothouse. Earth bank
covered with cement.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Thomas Russell, who cannot be seventy, at
whose house on Leyden Street I took tea and spent
the evening, told me that he remembered to have
seen Ebenezer Cobb, a native of Plymouth, who died
in Kingston in 1801, aged one hundred and seven, who
remembered to have had personal knowledge of Peregrine
White, saw him an old man riding on horseback
(he lived to be eighty-three). White was born at Cape
Cod Harbor before the Pilgrims got to Plymouth.
C. Sturgis’s mother told me the same of herself at the
same time. She remembered Cobb sitting in an arm
chair like the one she herself occupied, with his silver
locks falling about his shoulders, twirling one thumb
over the other. Lyell in first volume, “Second Visit,”
page 97, published 1849,<a name='FA_275' id='FA_275' href='#FN_275' class='fnanchor'>[275]</a> says: “Colonel Perkins, of
Boston, ... informed me, in 1846, that there was but
one link wanting in the chain of personal communication
between him and Peregrine White, the first white
child born in Massachusetts, a few days after the Pilgrims
landed. White lived to an advanced age, and
was known to a man of the name of Cobb, whom
Colonel Perkins visited, in 1807, with some friends
who yet survive. Cobb died in 1808, the year after
Colonel Perkins saw him.”

Russell told me that he once bought some <i>primitive</i>
woodland in Plymouth which was sold at auction—the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
biggest pitch pines two feet diameter—for <i>eight
shillings</i> an acre. If he had bought enough, it would
have been a fortune. There is still forest in this town
which the axe has not touched, says George Bradford.
According to Thatcher’s History of Plymouth, there
were 11,662 acres of woodland in 1831, or twenty square
miles. Pilgrims first saw Billington Sea about January
1st; visited it January 8th. The oldest stone in the
Plymouth Burying Ground, 1681. (Coles (?) Hill, where
those who died the first winter were buried, is said to
have been levelled and sown to conceal loss from Indians.)
Oldest on our hill, 1677. In Mrs. Plympton’s
garden on Leyden Street, running down to Town
Brook, saw an abundance of pears, gathered excellent
June-eating apples, saw a large lilac about eight inches
diameter. Methinks a soil may improve when at length
it has shaded itself with vegetation.
</p>

<p>
William S. Russell, the registrar at the court-house,
showed the oldest town records, for all are preserved.
On first page a plan of Leyden Street dated December,
1620, with names of settlers. They have a great many
folios. The writing plain. Saw the charter granted
by the Plymouth Company to the Pilgrims, signed by
Warwick, dated 1629, and the box in which it was
brought over, with the seal.
</p>

<p>
Pilgrim Hall. They used to crack off pieces of the
Forefathers’ Rock for visitors with a cold chisel, till
the town forbade it. The stone remaining at wharf is
about seven feet square. Saw two old armchairs that
came over in the Mayflower, the large picture by Sargent,
Standish’s sword, gun-barrel with which Philip
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
was killed, mug and pocket-book of Clark the mate,
iron pot of Standish, old pipe-tongs. Indian relics: a
<img src="images/i-405.jpg" width="101" height="36" alt="flayer" /> flayer; a pot or mortar of a kind <img src="images/i-405b.jpg" width="92" height="43" alt="Pot" />
of fire-proof stone, very hard, only
seven or eight inches long. A commission from Cromwell
to Winslow (?), his signature torn off. They talk
of a monument on the Rock. The Burying Hill 165
feet high. Manomet 394 feet high by State map. Saw
more pears at Washburn’s garden. No graves of Pilgrims.
</p>

<p>
Seaweed generally used along shore. Saw the <i>Prinos
glabra</i>, ink-berry, at Billington Sea. Sandy plain with
oaks of various kinds cut in less than twenty years.
No communication with Sandwich. Plymouth end of
world; fifty miles thither by railroad. Old Colony
road poor property. Nothing saves Plymouth but the
Rock. Fern-leaved beach.

<p>
I went to a menagerie the other day, advertised by
a flaming show-bill as big as a barn-door. The proprietors
had taken wonderful pains to collect rare and
interesting animals from all parts of the world, and
then placed by them a few stupid and ignorant fellows,
coachmen or stablers, who knew little or nothing about
the animals and were unwilling even to communicate
the little they knew. You catch a rare creature, interesting
to all mankind, and then place the first biped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
that comes along, with but a grain more reason in
him, to exhibit and describe the former. At the expense
of millions, this rare quadruped from the sun [<i>sic</i>] is
obtained, and then Jack Halyard or Tom Coach-whip
is hired to explain it. Why all this pains taken to catch
in Africa, and no pains taken to exhibit in America?
Not a cage was labelled. There was nobody to tell us
how or where the animals were caught, or what they
were. Probably the proprietors themselves do not
know,—or what their habits are. They told me that
a hyena came from South America. But hardly had
we been ushered into the presence of this choice, this
admirable collection, than a ring was formed for Master
Jack and the pony! Were they <i>animals</i>, then, who
had caught and exhibited these, and who had come to
see these? Would it not be worth the while to learn
something? to have some information imparted? The
absurdity of importing the behemoth, and then, instead
of somebody appearing [to] tell which it is, to
have to <i>while away the time</i>,—though your curiosity is
growing desperate to learn one fact about the creature,—to
have Jack and the pony introduced!!! Why, I
expected to see some descendant of Cuvier there, to improve
this opportunity for a lecture on natural history!
</p>

<p>
That is what they should do,—make this an occasion
for communicating some solid information. That
would be fun alive! that would be a sunny day, a sun
day, in one’s existence, not a secular day of Shetland
ponies. Not Jack and his pony and a tintamarre of
musical instruments, and a man with his head in the
lion’s mouth. First let him prove that he has got a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
head on his shoulders. I go not there to see a man hug
a lion or fondle a tiger, but to learn how he is related
to the wild beast. There’ll be All-Fools’ days enough
without our creating any intentionally. The presumption
is that men wish to behave like reasonable creatures;
that they do not need, and are not seeking,
relaxation; that they are not dissipated. Let it be a
travelling zoölogical garden, with a travelling professor
to accompany it. At present, foolishly, the professor
goes alone with his poor painted illustrations of
animals, while the menagerie takes another road, without
its professor,—only its keepers, stupid coachmen.

engaged in giving a course of lectures on Natural History.
Now why could they not put head and means
together for the benefit of mankind, and still get their
living? The present institution is imperfect precisely
because its object is to enrich Van Amburgh &amp; Co.,
and their low aim unfits them for rendering any more
valuable service; but no doubt the most valuable course
would also be the most valuable in a pecuniary sense.
No doubt a low self-interest is a better motive force
to these enterprises than no interest at all; but a high
self-interest, which consists with the greatest advantage
of all, would be a better still.

Item 2nd: Why have we not a decent pocket-map
of the State of Massachusetts? There is the large map.
Why is it not cut into half a dozen sheets and folded
into a small cover for the pocket? Are there no travellers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
to use it? Well, to tell the truth, there are but few, and
that’s the reason why. Men go by railroad, and State
maps hanging in bar-rooms are small enough. The
State has been admirably surveyed at a great cost, and
yet Dearborn’s Pocket-Map is the best one we have!

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 4.</i> Now the hardhack and meadow-sweet reign,
the former one of our handsomest flowers, I think. The
mayweed, too, dusty by the roadside, and in the fields
I scent the sweet-scented life-everlasting, which is half
expanded. The grass is withered by the drought. The
potatoes begin generally to flat down. The corn is tasselled
out; its crosses show in all fields above the blades.
The turnips are growing in its midst.
</p>

<p>
As my eye rested on the blossom of the meadowsweet
in a hedge, I heard the note of an autumnal
cricket, and was penetrated with the sense of autumn.
Was it sound? or was it form? or was it scent? or
was it flavor? It is now the royal month of August.
When I hear this sound, I am as dry as the rye which
is everywhere cut and housed, though I am drunk with
the season’s wine.
</p>

<p>
The farmer is the most inoffensive of men, with his
barns and cattle and poultry and grain and grass. I
like the smell of his hay well enough, though as grass it
may be in my way.
</p>

<p>
The yellow Bethlehem-star still, and the yellow
gerardia, and a bluish “savory-leaved aster.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 5.</i> 7.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—Moon half full. I sit beside Hubbard’s
Grove. A few level red bars above the horizon;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371' href='#Page_371'>371</a></span>
a dark, irregular bank beneath them, with a streak of
red sky below, on the horizon’s edge. This will describe
many a sunset. It is 8 o’clock. The farmer has driven
in his cows, and is cutting an armful of green corn fodder
for them. Another is still patching the roof of his
barn, making his hammer heard afar in the twilight, as
if he took a satisfaction in his elevated work,—sitting
astride the ridge,—which he wished to prolong. The
robin utters a sort of cackling note, as if he had learned
the ways of man. The air is still. I hear the voices of
loud-talking boys in the early twilight, it must be a mile
off. The swallows go over with a watery twittering.
</p>

<p>
When the moon is on the increase and half full, it is
already in mid-heavens at sunset, so that there is no
marked twilight intervening. I hear the whip-poor-will
at a distance, but they are few of late.
</p>

<p>
It is almost dark. I hear the voices of berry-pickers
coming homeward from Bear Garden. Why do they
go home, as it were defeated by the approaching night?
Did it never occur to them to stay overnight? The wind
now rising from over Bear Garden Hill falls gently on
my ear and delivers its message, the same that I have
so often heard passing over bare and stony mountain-tops,
so uncontaminated and untamed is the wind.
The air that has swept over Caucasus and the sands of
Arabia comes to breathe on New England fields. The
dogs bark; they are not as much stiller as man. They
are on the alert, suspecting the approach of foes. The
darkness perchance affects them, makes them mad
and wild. The mosquitoes hum about me. I distinguish
the modest moonlight on my paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As the twilight deepens and the moonlight is more
and more bright, I begin to distinguish myself, who I
am and where; as my walls contract, I become more
collected and composed, and sensible of my own existence,
as when a lamp is brought into a dark apartment
and I see who the company are. With the coolness and
the mild silvery light, I recover some sanity, my thoughts
are more distinct, moderated, and tempered. Reflection
is more possible while the day goes by. The intense
light of the sun unfits me for meditation, makes me
wander in my thought; my life is too diffuse and dissipated;
routine succeeds and prevails over us; the trivial
has greater power then, and most at noonday, the most
trivial hour of the twenty-four. I am sobered by the
moonlight. I bethink myself. It is like a cup of cold
water to a thirsty man. The moonlight is more favorable
to meditation than sunlight.
</p>

<p>
The sun lights this world from without, shines in at a
window, but the moon is like a lamp within an apartment.
It shines for us. The stars themselves make a
more visible, and hence a nearer and more domestic,
roof at night. Nature broods us, and has not left our
germs of thought to be hatched by the sun. We feel
her heat and see her body darkening over us. Our
thoughts are not dissipated, but come back to us like
an echo.
</p>

<p>
The different kinds of moonlight are infinite. This is
not a night for contrasts of light and shade, but a faint
diffused light in which there is light enough to travel,
and that is all.
</p>

<p>
A road (the Corner road) that passes over the height
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
of land between earth and heaven, separating those
streams which flow earthward from those which flow
heavenward.
</p>

<p>
Ah, what a poor, dry compilation is the “Annual of
Scientific Discovery!” I trust that observations are made
during the year which are not chronicled there,—that
some mortal may have caught a glimpse of Nature in
some corner of the earth during the year 1851. One sentence
of perennial poetry would make me forget, would
atone for, volumes of mere science. The astronomer is as
blind to the significant phenomena, or the significance
of phenomena, as the wood-sawyer who wears glasses to
defend his eyes from sawdust. The question is not what
you look at, but what you see.
</p>

<p>
I hear now from Bear Garden Hill—I rarely walk
by moonlight without hearing—the sound of a flute, or
a horn, or a human voice. It is a performer I never see
by day; should not recognize him if pointed out; but
you may hear his performance in every horizon. He
plays but one strain and goes to bed early, but I know
by the character of that single strain that he is deeply
dissatisfied with the manner in which he spends his
day. He is a slave who is purchasing his freedom. He
is Apollo watching the flocks of Admetus on every hill,
and this strain he plays every evening to remind him of
his heavenly descent. It is all that saves him,—his one
redeeming trait. It is a reminiscence; he loves to remember
his youth. He is sprung of a noble family. He is
highly related, I have no doubt; was tenderly nurtured
in his infancy, poor hind as he is. That noble strain he
utters, instead of any jewel on his finger, or precious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
locket fastened to his breast, or purple garments that
came with him. The elements recognize him, and echo
his strain. All the dogs know him their master, though
lords and ladies, rich men and learned, know him not.
He is the son of a rich man, of a famous man who served
his country well. He has heard his sire’s stories. I
thought of the time when he would discover his parentage,
obtain his inheritance and sing a strain suited to
the morning hour. He cherishes hopes. I never see the
man by day who plays that clarionet.
</p>

<p>
The distant lamps in the farmhouse look like fires.
The trees and clouds are seen at a distance reflected in
the river as by day. I see Fair Haven Pond from the
Cliffs, as it were through a slight mist. It is the wildest
scenery imaginable,—a Lake of the Woods. I just
remembered the wildness of St. Anne’s. That’s the
Ultima Thule of wildness to me.
</p>

<p>
What an entertainment for the traveller, this incessant
motion apparently of the moon traversing the clouds!
Whether you sit or stand, it is always preparing new
developments for you. It is event enough for simple
minds. You all alone, the moon all alone, overcoming
with incessant victory whole squadrons of clouds above
the forests and the lakes and rivers and the mountains.
You cannot always calculate which one the moon will
undertake next.<a name='FA_276' id='FA_276' href='#FN_276' class='fnanchor'>[276]</a>

<p>
I see a solitary firefly over the woods.
</p>

<p>
The moon wading through clouds; though she is
eclipsed by this one, I see her shining on a more distant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
but lower one. The entrance into Hubbard’s Wood
above the spring, coming from the hill, is like the entrance
to a cave; but when you are within, there are
some streaks of light on the edge of the path.
</p>

<p>
All these leaves so still, none whispering, no birds in
motion,—how can I be else than still and thoughtful?
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 6.</i> The motions of circus horses are not so
expressive of music, do not harmonize so well with a
strain of music, as those of animals of the cat kind.
An Italian has just carried a hand-organ through the
village. I hear it even at Walden Wood. It is as if a
cheeta had skulked, howling, through the streets of
the village, with knotted tail, and left its perfume
there.
</p>

<p>
Neglected gardens are full of fleabane (?) now, not
yet in blossom. Thoroughwort has opened, and goldenrod
is gradually opening. The smooth sumach shows
its red fruit. The berries of the bristly aralia are turning
dark. The wild holly’s scarlet fruit is seen and the
red cherry (<i>Cerasus</i>). After how few steps, how little
exertion, the student stands in pine woods above the
Solomon’s-seal and the cow-wheat, in a place still unaccountably
strange and wild to him, and to all civilization!
This so easy and so common, though our literature
implies that it is rare! We in the country make
no report of the seals and sharks in our neighborhood
to those in the city. We send them only our huckleberries,
not free wild thoughts.

<p>
Why does not man sleep all day as well as all night,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
it seems so very natural and easy? For what is he
awake?
</p>

<p>
A man must generally get away some hundreds or
thousands of miles from home before he can be said to
begin his travels. Why not begin his travels at home?
Would he have to go far or look very closely to discover
novelties? The traveller who, in this sense, pursues his
travels at home, has the advantage at any rate of a long
residence in the country to make his observations correct
and profitable. Now the American goes to England,
while the Englishman comes to America, in order
to describe the country. No doubt there [are] some advantages
in this kind of mutual criticism. But might
there not be invented a better way of coming at the
truth than this scratch-my-back-and-I’ll-scratch-yours
method? Would not the American, for instance, who
had himself, perchance, travelled in England and elsewhere
make the most profitable and accurate traveller
in his own country? How often it happens that the
traveller’s principal distinction is that he is one who
knows less about a country than a native! Now if he
should begin with all the knowledge of a native, and add
thereto the knowledge of a traveller, both natives and
foreigners would be obliged to read his book; and the
world would be absolutely benefited. It takes a man of
genius to travel in his own country, in his native village;
to make any progress between his door and his gate.
But such a traveller will make the distances which
Hanno and Marco Polo and Cook and Ledyard went
over ridiculous. So worthy a traveller as William Bartram
heads his first chapter with the words, “The author
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
sets sail from Philadelphia, and arrives at Charleston,
from whence he begins his travels.”
</p>

<p>
I am, perchance, most and most profitably interested
in the things which I already know a little about; a
mere and utter novelty is a mere monstrosity to me. I
am interested to see the yellow pine, which we have not
in Concord, though Michaux says it grows in Massachusetts;
or the Oriental plane, having often heard of it
and being well acquainted with its sister, the Occidental
plane; or the English oak, having heard of the royal oak
and having oaks ourselves; but the new Chinese flower,
whose cousin I do not happen to know, I pass by with
indifference. I do not know that I am very fond of
novelty. I wish to get a clearer notion of what I have
already some inkling.
</p>

<p>
These Italian boys with their hand-organs remind
me of the keepers of wild beasts in menageries, whose
whole art consists in stirring up their beasts from time
to time with a pole. I am reminded of bright flowers
and glancing birds and striped pards of the jungle;
these delicious harmonies tear me to pieces while they
charm me. The tiger’s musical smile.
</p>

<p>
How some inventions have spread! Some, brought
to perfection by the most enlightened nations, have
been surely and rapidly communicated to the most savage.
The gun, for instance. How soon after the settlement
of America were comparatively remote Indian
tribes, most of whose members had never seen a white
man, supplied with guns! The gun is invented by the
civilized man, and the savage in remote wildernesses on
the other side of the globe throws away his bow and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
arrows and takes up this arm. Bartram, travelling in the
Southern States between 1770 and 1780, describes the
warriors as so many gun-men.
</p>

<p>
Ah, yes, even here in Concord horizon Apollo is at
work for King Admetus! Who is King Admetus? It is
Business, with his four prime ministers Trade and Commerce
and Manufactures and Agriculture. And this is
what makes mythology true and interesting to us.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 8.</i> 7.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—To Conantum.
</p>

<p>
The moon has not yet quite filled her horns. I perceive
why we so often remark a dark cloud in the west
at and after sunset. It is because it is almost directly
between us and the sun, and hence we see the dark
side, and moreover it is much darker than it otherwise
would be, because of the little light reflected from the
earth at that hour. The same cloud at midday and
overhead might not attract attention. There is a pure
amber sky beneath the present bank, thus framed off
from the rest of the heavens, which, with the outlines of
small dead elms seen against it,—I hardly know if far
or near,—make picture enough. Men will travel far
to see less interesting sights than this. Turning away
from the sun, we get this enchanting view, as when a man
looks at the landscape with inverted head. Under
shadow of the dark cloud which I have described, the
cricket begins his strain, his ubiquitous strain. Is there
a fall cricket distinct from the species we hear in spring
and summer? I smell the corn-field over the brook a
dozen rods off, and it reminds me of the green-corn
feasts of the Indians. The evening train comes rolling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' name='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
in, but none of the passengers jumping out in such
haste attend to the beautiful, fresh picture which Nature
has unrolled in the west and surmounted with that dark
frame. The circular platter of the carrot’s blossom is
now perfect.
</p>

<p>
Might not this be called the Invalid’s Moon, on account
of the warmth of the nights? The principal employment
of the farmers now seems to be getting their
meadow-hay and cradling some oats, etc.
</p>

<p>
The light from the western sky is stronger still than
that of the moon, and when I hold up my hand, the
west side is lighted while the side toward the moon is
comparatively dark. But now that I have put this dark
wood (Hubbard’s) between me and the west, I see the
moonlight plainly on my paper; I am even startled by
it. One star, too,—is it Venus?—I see in the west.
Starlight! that would be a good way to mark the hour,
if we were precise. Hubbard’s Brook. How much the
beauty of the moon is enhanced by being seen shining
between two trees, or even by the neighborhood of
clouds! I hear the clock striking eight faintly. I smell
the late shorn meadows.
</p>

<p>
One will lose no music by not attending the oratorios
and operas. The really inspiring melodies are cheap
and universal, and are as audible to the poor man’s son
as to the rich man’s. Listening to the harmonies of the
universe is not allied to dissipation. My neighbors have
gone to the vestry to hear “Ned Kendal,” the bugler,
to-night, but I am come forth to the hills to hear my
bugler in the horizon. I can forego the seeming advantages
of cities without misgiving. No heavenly strain is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
lost to the ear that is fitted to hear it, for want of money
or opportunity. I am convinced that for instrumental
music all Vienna cannot serve me more than the Italian
boy who seeks my door with his organ.
</p>

<p>
And now I strike the road at the causeway. It is
hard, and I hear the sound of my steps, a sound which
should never be heard, for it draws down my thoughts.
It is more like the treadmill exercise. The fireflies are
not so numerous as they have been. There is no dew
as yet. The planks and railing of Hubbard’s Bridge are
removed. I walk over on the string-pieces, resting in the
middle until the moon comes out of a cloud, that I
may see my path, for between the next piers the string-pieces
also are removed and there is only a rather narrow
plank, let down three or four feet. I essay to cross
it, but it springs a little and I mistrust myself, whether
I shall not plunge into the river. Some demonic genius
seems to be warning me. Attempt not the passage; you
will surely be drowned. It is very real that I am thus
affected. Yet I am fully aware of the absurdity of
minding such suggestions. I put out my foot, but I am
checked, as if that power had laid a hand on my breast
and chilled me back. Nevertheless, I cross, stooping
at first, and gain the other side. (I make the most of it
on account of the admonition, but it was nothing to remark
on. I returned the same way two hours later and
made nothing of it.) It is easy to see how, by yielding
to such feelings as this, men would reëstablish all the
superstitions of antiquity. It is best that reason should
govern us, and not these blind intimations, in which we
exalt our fears into a genius.

On Conantum I sit awhile in the shade of the woods
and look out on the moonlit fields. White rocks are more
remarkable than by day.<a name='FA_277' id='FA_277' href='#FN_277' class='fnanchor'>[277]</a>
</p>

<p>
The air is warmer than the rocks now. It is perfectly
warm and I am tempted to stay out all night and observe
each phenomenon of the night until day dawns. But
if I should do so, I should not wonder if the town were
raised to hunt me up. I could lie out here on this pinnacle
rock all night without cold. To lie here on your
back with nothing between your eye and the stars,—nothing
but space,—they your nearest neighbors on
that side, be they strange or be they tame, be they other
worlds or merely ornaments to this, who could ever go
to sleep under these circumstances? Sitting on the door-step
of Conant house at 9 o’clock, I hear a pear drop.
How few of all the apples that fall do we hear fall! I
hear a horse <i>sneeze</i> (?) from time to time in his pasture.
He sees me and knows me to be a man, though I do not
see him. I hear the nine o’clock bell ringing in Bedford.
An unexpectedly musical sound that of a bell in the
horizon always is. Pleasantly sounds the voice of one
village to another. It is sweet as it is rare. Since I sat
here a bright star has gone behind the stem of a tree,
proving that my machine is moving,—proving it better
for me than a rotating pendulum. I hear a solitary
whip-poor-will, and a bullfrog on the river,—fewer
sounds than in spring. The gray cliffs across the river
are plain to be seen.
</p>

<p>
And now the star appears on the other side of the
tree, and I must go. Still no dew up here. I see three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
scythes hanging on an apple tree. There is the wild
apple tree where hangs the forgotten scythe,<a name='FA_278' id='FA_278' href='#FN_278' class='fnanchor'>[278]</a>—the
rock where the shoe was left. The woods and the separate
trees cast longer shadows than by day, for the moon
goes lower in her course at this season. Some dew at
last in the meadow. As I recross the string-pieces of the
bridge, I see the water-bugs swimming briskly in the
moonlight. I scent the Roman wormwood in the potato-fields.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 9. Saturday.</i> Tansy now in bloom and the
fresh white clethra. Among the pines and birches I
hear the invisible locust. As I am going to the pond to
bathe, I see a black cloud in the northern horizon and
hear the muttering of thunder, and make haste. Before
I have bathed and dressed, the gusts which precede the
tempest are heard roaring in the woods, and the first
black, gusty clouds have reached my zenith. Hastening
toward town, I meet the rain at the edge of the wood, and
take refuge under the thickest leaves, where not a drop
reaches me, and, at the end of half an hour, the renewed
singing of the birds alone advertises me that the rain
has ceased, and it is only the dripping from the leaves
which I hear in the woods. It was a splendid sunset
that day, a celestial light on all the land, so that all people
went to their doors and windows to look on the grass
and leaves and buildings and the sky, and it was equally
glorious in whatever quarter you looked; a sort of fulgor
as of stereotyped lightning filled the air. Of which
this is my solution. We were in the westernmost edge of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
the shower at the moment the sun was setting, and its
rays shone through the cloud and the falling rain. We
were, in fact, in a rainbow and it was here its arch
rested on the earth. At a little distance we should have
seen all the colors.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Œnothera biennis</i> along the railroad now. Do
the cars disperse seeds? The <i>Trichostema dichotomum</i>
is quite beautiful now in the cool of the morning. The
epilobium in the woods still. Now the earliest apples
begin to be ripe, but none are so good to eat as some
to smell. Some knurly apple which I pick up in the
road reminds me by its fragrance of all the wealth of
Pomona.<a name='FA_279' id='FA_279' href='#FN_279' class='fnanchor'>[279]</a>

<i>Aug. 12. Tuesday.</i> 1.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—Full moon. Arose
and went to the river and bathed, stepping very carefully
not to disturb the household, and still carefully in the
street not to disturb the neighbors. I did not walk
naturally and freely till I had got over the wall. Then
to Hubbard’s Bridge at 2 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> There was a whip-poor-will
in the road just beyond Goodwin’s, which flew up
and lighted on the fence and kept alighting on the fence
within a rod of me and circling round me with a slight
squeak as if inquisitive about me. I do not remember
what I observed or thought in coming hither.
</p>

<p>
The traveller’s whole employment is to calculate
what cloud will obscure the moon and what she will
triumph over. In the after-midnight hours the traveller’s
sole companion is the moon. All his thoughts are centred
in her. She is waging continual war with the clouds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
in his behalf. What cloud will enter the lists with her
next, this employs his thoughts; and when she enters
on a clear field of great extent in the heavens, and shines
unobstructedly, he is glad. And when she has fought
her way through all the squadrons of her foes, and rides
majestic in a clear sky, he cheerfully and confidently
pursues his way, and rejoices in his heart. But if he sees
that she has many new clouds to contend with, he pursues
his way moodily, as one disappointed and aggrieved;
he resents it as an injury to himself. It is his employment
to watch the moon, the companion and guide of
his journey, wading through clouds, and calculate what
one is destined to shut out her cheering light. He traces
her course, now almost completely obscured, through
the ranks of her foes, and calculates where she will
issue from them.<a name='FA_280' id='FA_280' href='#FN_280' class='fnanchor'>[280]</a> He is disappointed and saddened
when he sees that she has many clouds to contend with.

<p>
Sitting on the sleepers of Hubbard’s Bridge, which
is being repaired, now, 3 o’clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, I hear a cock
crow. How admirably adapted to the dawn is that
sound! as if made by the first rays of light rending the
darkness, the creaking of the sun’s axle heard already
over the eastern hills.
</p>

<p>
Though man’s life is trivial and handselled, Nature is
holy and heroic. With what infinite faith and promise
and moderation begins each new day! It is only a little
after 3 o’clock, and already there is evidence of morning
in the sky.
</p>

He rejoices when the moon comes forth from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' name='Page_385' href='#Page_385'>385</a></span>
squadrons of the clouds unscathed and there are no
more any obstructions in her path, and the cricket also
seems to express joy in his song. It does not concern
men who are asleep in their beds, but it is very important
to the traveller, whether the moon shines bright
and unobstructed or is obscured by clouds. It is not
easy to realize the serene joy of all the earth when the
moon commences to shine unobstructedly, unless you
have often been a traveller by night.<a name='FA_281' id='FA_281' href='#FN_281' class='fnanchor'>[281]</a>
</p>

<p>
The traveller also resents it if the wind rises and
rustles the leaves or ripples the water and increases the
coolness at such an hour.
</p>

<p>
A solitary horse in his pasture was scared by the sudden
sight of me, an apparition to him, standing still in
the moonlight, and moved about, inspecting with alarm,
but I spoke and he heard the sound of my voice; he was
at once reassured and expressed his pleasure by wagging
his stump of a tail, though still half a dozen rods
off. How wholesome the taste of huckleberries, when
now by moonlight I feel for them amid the bushes!
</p>

<p>
And now the first signs of morning attract the traveller’s
attention, and he cannot help rejoicing, and the
moon begins gradually to fade from his recollection.
The wind rises and rustles the copses. The sand is cool
on the surface but warm two or three inches beneath,
and the rocks are quite warm to the hand, so that he
sits on them or leans against them for warmth, though
indeed it is not cold elsewhere.<a name='FA_282' id='FA_282' href='#FN_282' class='fnanchor'>[282]</a> As I walk along the
side of Fair Haven Hill, I see a ripple on the river, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386' href='#Page_386'>386</a></span>
now the moon has gone behind a large and black mass
of clouds, and I realize that I may not see her again in her
glory this night, that perchance ere she rises from this
obscurity, the sun will have risen, and she will appear
but as a cloud herself, and sink unnoticed into the west
(being a little after full (a day?)). As yet no sounds
of awakening men; only the more frequent crowing of
cocks, still standing on their perches in the barns. The
milkmen are the earliest risers,—though I see no lanthorns
carried to their barns in the distance,—preparing
to carry the milk of cows in their tin cans for men’s
breakfasts, even for those who dwell in distant cities.
In the twilight now, by the light of the stars alone, the
moon being concealed, they are pressing the bounteous
streams from full udders into their milk-pails, and the
sound of the streaming milk is all that breaks the sacred
stillness of the dawn; distributing their milk to such as
have no cows. I perceive no mosquitoes now. Are they
vespertinal, like the singing of the whip-poor-will? I
see the light of the obscured moon reflected from the
river brightly. With what mild emphasis Nature marks
the spot!—so bright and serene a sheen that does not
more contrast with the night.
</p>

<p>
4 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—It adds a charm, a dignity, a glory, to the
earth to see the light of the moon reflected from her
streams. There are but us three, the moon, the earth
which wears this jewel (the moon’s reflection) in her
crown, and myself. Now there has come round the
Cliff (on which I sit), which faces the west, all unobserved
and mingled with the dusky sky of night, a lighter
and more ethereal living blue, whispering of the sun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_387' name='Page_387' href='#Page_387'>387</a></span>
still far, far away, behind the horizon. From the summit
of our atmosphere, perchance, he may already be
seen by soaring spirits that inhabit those thin upper
regions, and they communicate the glorious intelligence
to us lower ones. The real <i>divine</i>, the heavenly, blue,
the Jove-containing air, it is, I see through this dusky
lower stratum. The sun gilding the summits of the air.
The broad artery of light flows over all the sky. Yet
not without sadness and compassion I reflect that I shall
not see the moon again in her glory. (Not far from
four, still in the night, I heard a nighthawk squeak and
<i>boom</i>, high in the air, as I sat on the Cliff. What is said
about this being less of a night bird than the whip-poor-will
is perhaps to be questioned. For neither do I
remember to have heard the whip-poor-will <i>sing</i> at
12 o’clock, though I met one sitting and flying between
two and three this morning. I believe that both may
be heard at midnight, though very rarely.) Now at <i>very
earliest</i> dawn the nighthawk booms and the whip-poor-will
sings. Returning down the hill by the path to where
the woods [are] cut off, I see the signs of the day, the
morning red. There is the lurid morning star, soon to
be blotted out by a cloud.
</p>

<p>
There is an early redness in the east which I was not
prepared for, changing to amber or saffron, with clouds
beneath in the horizon and also above this clear streak.
</p>

<p>
The birds utter a few languid and yawning notes, as
if they had not left their perches, so sensible to light to
wake so soon,—a faint peeping sound from I know
not what kind, a slight, innocent, half-awake sound,
like the sounds which a quiet housewife makes in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
earliest dawn. Nature preserves her innocence like a
beautiful child. I hear a wood thrush even now, long
before sunrise, as in the heat of the day. And the pewee
and the catbird and the vireo, red-eyed? I do not hear—or
do not mind, perchance—the crickets now. Now
whip-poor-wills commence to sing in earnest, considerably
<i>after</i> the wood thrush. The wood thrush, that
beautiful singer, inviting the day once more to enter
his pine woods. (So you may hear the wood thrush
and whip-poor-will at the same time.) Now go by two
whip-poor-wills, in haste seeking some coverts from the
eye of day. And the bats are flying about on the edge
of the wood, improving the last moments of their day in
catching insects. The moon appears at length, not yet
as a cloud, but with a frozen light, ominous of her fate.
The early cars sound like a wind in the woods. The
chewinks make a business now of waking each other
up with their low <i>yorrick</i> in the neighboring low copse.
The sun would have shown before but for the cloud.
Now, on his rising, not the clear sky, but the cheeks of
the clouds high and wide, are tinged with red, which,
like the sky before, turns gradually to saffron and then
to the white light of day.

corymb is not merely terminal, florets eight and nine.
Differs from <i>verticillatum</i> in the stem being not solid, and

<i>Aug. 17.</i> For a day or two it has been quite cool, a
coolness that was felt even when sitting by an open window
in a thin coat on the west side of the house in the
morning, and you naturally sought the sun at that hour.
The coolness concentrated your thought, however. As
I could not command a sunny window, I went abroad
on the morning of the 15th and lay in the sun in the
fields in my thin coat, though it was rather cool even
there. I feel as if this coolness would do me good. If
it only makes my life more pensive! Why should pensiveness
be akin to sadness? There is a certain fertile
sadness which I would not avoid, but rather earnestly
seek. It is positively joyful to me. It saves my life from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
being trivial. My life flows with a deeper current, no
longer as a shallow and brawling stream, parched and
shrunken by the summer heats. This coolness comes
to condense the dews and clear the atmosphere. The
stillness seems more deep and significant. Each sound
seems to come from out a greater thoughtfulness in
nature, as if nature had acquired some character and
mind. The cricket, the gurgling stream, the rushing
wind amid the trees, all speak to me soberly yet encouragingly
of the steady onward progress of the universe.
My heart leaps into my mouth at the sound of
the wind in the woods. I, whose life was but yesterday
so desultory and shallow, suddenly recover my spirits,
my spirituality, through my hearing. I see a goldfinch
go twittering through the still, louring day, and am reminded
of the peeping flocks which will soon herald the
thoughtful season. Ah! if I could so live that there
should be no desultory moment in all my life! that in
the trivial season, when small fruits are ripe, my fruits
might be ripe also! that I could match nature always
with my moods! that in each season when some part of
nature especially flourishes, then a corresponding part
of me may not fail to flourish! Ah, I would walk, I
would sit and sleep, with natural piety! What if I could
pray aloud or to myself as I went along by the brooksides
a cheerful prayer like the birds! For joy I could
embrace the earth; I shall delight to be buried in it.
And then to think of those I love among men, who will
know that I love them though I tell them not! I sometimes
feel as if I were rewarded merely for expecting
better hours. I did not despair of worthier moods, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
now I have occasion to be grateful for the flood of life
that is flowing over me. I am not so poor: I can smell
the ripening apples; the very rills are deep; the autumnal
flowers, the <i>Trichostema dichotomum</i>,—not only
its bright blue flower above the sand, but its strong
wormwood scent which belongs to the season,—feed
my spirit, endear the earth to me, make me value myself
and rejoice; the quivering of pigeons’ wings reminds
me of the tough fibre of the air which they rend.
I thank you, God. I do not deserve anything, I am
unworthy of the least regard; and yet I am made to
rejoice. I am impure and worthless, and yet the world
is gilded for my delight and holidays are prepared for
me, and my path is strewn with flowers. But I cannot
thank the Giver; I cannot even whisper my thanks to
those human friends I have. It seems to me that I am
more rewarded for my expectations than for anything I
do or can do. Ah, I would not tread on a cricket in
whose song is such a revelation, so soothing and cheering
to my ear! Oh, keep my senses pure! And why should
I speak to my friends? for how rarely is it that I am I;
and are they, then, they? We will meet, then, far away.
The seeds of the summer are getting dry and falling
from a thousand nodding heads. If I did not know you
through thick and thin, how should I know you at all?
Ah, the very brooks seem fuller of reflections than they
were! Ah, such provoking sibylline sentences they are!
The shallowest is all at once unfathomable. How can
that depth be fathomed where a man may see himself
reflected? The rill I stopped to drink at I drink in more
than I expected. I satisfy and still provoke the thirst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
of thirsts. Nut Meadow Brook where it crosses the
road beyond Jenny Dugan’s that was. I do not drink
in vain. I mark that brook as if I had swallowed a water
snake that would live in my stomach. I have swallowed
something worth the while. The day is not what it was
before I stooped to drink. Ah, I shall hear from that
draught! It is not in vain that I have drunk. I have
drunk an arrowhead. It flows from where all fountains
rise.
</p>

<p>
How many ova have I swallowed? Who knows what
will be hatched within me? There were some seeds of
thought, methinks, floating in that water, which are
expanding in me. The man must not drink of the running
streams, the living waters, who is not prepared to
have all nature reborn in him,—to suckle monsters.
The snake in my stomach lifts his head to my mouth at
the sound of running water. When was it that I swallowed
a snake? I have got rid of the snake in my
stomach. I drank of stagnant waters once. That accounts
for it. I caught him by the throat and drew him
out, and had a well day after all. Is there not such a
thing as getting rid of the snake which you have swallowed
when young, when thoughtless you stooped and
drank at stagnant waters, which has worried you in
your waking hours and in your sleep ever since, and
appropriated the life that was yours? Will he not ascend
into your mouth at the sound of running water? Then
catch him boldly by the head and draw him out, though
you may think his tail be curled about your vitals.

The farmers are just finishing their meadow-haying.
(To-day is Sunday.) Those who have early potatoes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
may be digging them, or doing any other job which the
haying has obliged them to postpone. For six weeks
or more this has been the farmer’s work, to shave the
surface of the fields and meadows clean. This is done
all over the country. The razor is passed over these
parts of nature’s face the country over. A thirteenth
labor which methinks would have broken the back of
Hercules, would have given him a memorable sweat,
accomplished with what sweating of scythes and early
and late! I chance [to] know one young man who has
lost his life in this season’s campaign, by overdoing. In
haying time some men take double wages, and they are
engaged long before in the spring. To shave all the
fields and meadows of New England clean! If men did
this but once, and not every year, we should never hear
the last of that labor; it would be more famous in each
farmer’s case than Buonaparte’s road over the Simplon.
It has no other bulletin but the truthful “Farmer’s Almanac.”
Ask them where scythe-snaths are made and
sold, and rifles too, if it is not a real labor. In its very weapons
and its passes it has the semblance of war. Mexico
was won with less exertion and less true valor than are
required to do one season’s haying in New England. The
former work was done by those who played truant and
ran away from the latter. Those Mexicans were mown
down more easily than the summer’s crop of grass in
many a farmer’s fields. Is there not some work in New
England men? This haying is no work for marines,
nor for deserters; nor for United States troops, so called,
nor for West Point cadets. It would wilt them, and they
would desert. Have they not deserted? and run off to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
West Point? Every field is a battle-field to the mower,—a
pitched battle too,—and whole winrows of dead
have covered it in the course of the season. Early and
late the farmer has gone forth with his formidable
scythe, weapon of time, Time’s weapon, and fought the
ground inch by inch. It is the summer’s enterprise. And
if we were a more poetic people, horns would be blown
to celebrate its completion. There might be a Haymakers’
Day. New England’s peaceful battles. At
Bunker Hill there were some who stood at the rail-fence
and behind the winrows of new-mown hay.<a name='FA_284' id='FA_284' href='#FN_284' class='fnanchor'>[284]</a> They
have not yet quitted the field. They stand there still;
they alone have not retreated.

I have been to Tarbell’s Swamp by the Second Division
this afternoon, and to the Marlborough road.
</p>

<p>
It has promised rain all day; cloudy and still and
rather cool; from time to time a few drops gently spitting,
but no shower. The landscape wears a sober
autumnal look. I hear a drop or two on my hat. I wear
a thick coat. The birds seem to know that it will not
rain just yet. The swallows skim low over the pastures,
twittering as they fly near me with forked tail, dashing
near me as if I scared up insects for them. I see where a
squirrel has been eating hazelnuts on a stump.
</p>

<p>
Tarbell’s Swamp is mainly composed of low and even
but dense beds of <i>Andromeda calyculata</i>, or dwarf andromeda,
which bears the early flower in the spring.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
Here and there, mingled with it, is the water (?) andromeda;
also pitch pines, birches, hardhack, and the
common alder (<i>Alnus serrulata</i>), and, in separate and
lower beds, the cranberry; and probably the <i>Rhodora
Canadensis</i> might be found.
</p>

<p>
The lead-colored berries of the <i>Viburnum dentatum</i>
now. Cow-wheat and indigo-weed still in bloom by the
dry wood-path-side, and Norway cinquefoil. I detected
a wild apple on the Marlborough road by its fragrance, in
the thick woods; small stems, four inches in diameter,
falling over or leaning like rays on every side; a clean
white fruit, the ripest yellowish, a pleasant acid. The
fruit covered the ground. It is unusual to meet with an
early apple thus wild in the thickest woods. It seemed
admirable to me. One of the noblest of fruits. With
green specks under the skin.
</p>

<p>
<i>Prenanthes alba</i>, white-flowering prenanthes, with its
strange halbert and variously shaped leaves; neottia;
and hypericum.
</p>

<p>
I hear the rain (11 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>) distilling upon the ground,
wetting the grass and leaves. The melons needed it.
Their leaves were curled and their fruit stinted.
</p>

<p>
I am less somnolent for the cool season. I wake to a
perennial day.
</p>

<p>
The hayer’s work is done, but I hear no boasting,
no firing of guns nor ringing of bells. He celebrates it
by going about the work he had postponed “till after
haying”! If all this steadiness and valor were spent
upon some still worthier enterprise!!

<p>
All men’s employments, all trades and professions, in
some of their aspects are attractive. Hence the boy I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
knew, having sucked cider at a minister’s cider-mill, resolved
to be a minister and make cider, not thinking,
boy as he was, how little fun there was in being a
minister, willing to purchase that pleasure at any price.
When I saw the carpenters the other day repairing
Hubbard’s Bridge, their bench on the new planking
they had laid over the water in the sun and air, with no
railing yet to obstruct the view, I was almost ready to
resolve that I would be a carpenter and work on bridges,
to secure a pleasant place to work. One of the men had
a fish-line cast round a sleeper, which he looked at from
time to time.

Some dogs, I have noticed, have a propensity to worry
cows. They go off by themselves to distant pastures,
and ever and anon, like four-legged devils, they worry
the cows,—literally full of the devil. They are so full
of the devil they know not what to do. I come to interfere
between the cows and their tormentors. Ah, I
grieve to see the devils escape so easily by their swift

limbs, imps of mischief! They are the dog state of those
boys who pull down hand-bills in the streets. Their
next migration perchance will be into such dogs as these,
ignoble fate! The dog, whose office it should be to guard

Those soldiers in the Champ de Mars<a name='FA_286' id='FA_286' href='#FN_286' class='fnanchor'>[286]</a> at Montreal
convinced me that I had arrived in a foreign country
under a different government, where many are under
the control of one. Such perfect drill could never be in
a republic. Yet it had the effect on us as when the

other.<a name='FA_287' id='FA_287' href='#FN_287' class='fnanchor'>[287]</a> I have no doubt that soldiers well drilled, as

It is evident that a private man is not worth so much
in Canada as in the United States, and if that is the bulk
of a man’s property, <i>i. e.</i> the being private and peculiar,
he had better stay here. An Englishman, methinks, not
to speak of other nations, habitually regards himself
merely as a constituent part of the English nation; he
holds a recognized place as such; he is a member of the
royal regiment of Englishmen. And he is proud of his
nation. But an American cares very little about such,
and greater freedom and independence are possible to
him. He is nearer to the primitive condition of man.
Government lets him alone, and he lets government
alone.<a name='FA_290' id='FA_290' href='#FN_290' class='fnanchor'>[290]</a>

Quebec began to be fortified in a more regular manner

<p>
The most modern fortifications have an air of antiquity
about them; they have the aspect of ruins in better
or worse repair,—ruins kept in repair from the
day they were built, though they were completed yesterday,—because
they are not in a true sense the work
of this age. I couple them with the dismantled Spanish
forts to be found in so many parts of the world. They
carry me back to the Middle Ages, and the siege of
Jerusalem, and St. Jean d’Acre, and the days of the
Bucaniers. Such works are not consistent with the

all kinds, both by their creation and their influence,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
rather oppress the intellect than set it free. A little
thought will dismantle them as fast as they are built.
They are a bungling contrivance. It is an institution
as rotten as the church. The sentinel with his musket
beside a man with his umbrella is spectral. There is
not sufficient reason for his existence. My friend there,
with a bullet resting on half an ounce of powder, does
he think that he needs that argument in conversing with
me? Of what use this fortification, to look at it from
the soldier’s point of view? General Wolfe sailed by it
with impunity, and took the town of Quebec without
experiencing any hindrance from its fortifications. How
often do we have to read that the enemy occupied a
position which commanded the old, and so the fort
was evacuated!<a name='FA_291' id='FA_291' href='#FN_291' class='fnanchor'>[291]</a>

It is as if I were to come to a country village surrounded

slung to him, endeavoring to go about his business.

The idea seemed to be that some time the inhabitants

at his vitals. The English in Canada seem to be everywhere
prepared and preparing for war. In the United
States they are prepared for anything; they may even
be the aggressors. This is a ruin kept in a remarkably
good repair. There are some eight hundred or a thousand
men there to exhibit it. One regiment goes bare-legged

This is a world where there are flowers. Now, at

The way in which men cling to old institutions after
the life has departed out of them, and out of themselves,
reminds me of those monkeys which cling by their tails,—aye,
whose tails contract about the limbs, even the dead
limbs, of the forest, and they hang suspended beyond
the hunter’s reach long after they are dead. It is of no
use to argue with such men. They have not an apprehensive
intellect, but merely, as it were, a prehensile
tail. Their intellect possesses merely the quality of a
prehensile tail. The tail itself contracts around the dead
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
limb even after they themselves are dead, and not till
sensible corruption takes place do they fall. The black
howling monkey, or caraya. According to Azara, it is
extremely difficult to get at them, for “when mortally
wounded they coil the tail round a branch, and hang
by it with the head downwards for days after death,
and until, in fact, decomposition begins to take effect.”
The commenting naturalist says, “A singular peculiarity
of this organ is to contract at its extremity of its
own accord as soon as it is extended to its full length.”
I relinquish argument, I wait for decomposition to take
place, for the subject is dead; as I value the hide for
the museum. They say, “Though you’ve got my soul,
you sha’n’t have my carcass.”

How many things concur to keep a man at home, to
prevent his yielding to his inclination to wander! If I
would extend my walk a hundred miles, I must carry
a tent on my back for shelter at night or in the rain, or
at least I must carry a thick coat to be prepared for a
change in the weather. So that it requires some resolution,
as well as energy and foresight, to undertake the
simplest journey. Man does not travel as easily as the
birds migrate. He is not everywhere at home, like flies.
When I think how many things I can conveniently carry,
I am wont to think it most convenient to stay at home.
My home, then, to a certain extent is the place where I
keep my thick coat and my tent and some books which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
I cannot carry; where, next, I can depend upon meeting
some friends; and where, finally, I, even I, have
established myself in business. But this last in my case
is the least important qualification of a home.

The poet must be continually watching the moods
of his mind, as the astronomer watches the aspects of
the heavens. What might we not expect from a long
life faithfully spent in this wise? The humblest observer
would see some stars shoot. A faithful description as
by a disinterested person of the thoughts which visited
a certain mind in threescore years and ten, as when
one reports the number and character of the vehicles
which pass a particular point. As travellers go round
the world and report natural objects and phenomena,
so faithfully let another stay at home and report the
phenomena of his own life,—catalogue stars, those
thoughts whose orbits are as rarely calculated as comets.
It matters not whether they visit my mind or yours,—whether
the meteor falls in my field or in yours,—only
that it come from heaven. (I am not concerned to
express that kind of truth which Nature has expressed.
Who knows but I may suggest some things to her?
Time was when she was indebted to such suggestions
from another quarter, as her present advancement
shows. I deal with the truths that recommend themselves

Some institutions—most institutions, indeed—have
had a divine origin. But of most that we see prevailing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
in society nothing but the form, the shell, is left;
the life is extinct, and there is nothing divine in them.
Then the reformer arises inspired to reinstitute life,
and whatever he does or causes to be done is a reëstablishment
of that same or a similar divineness. But some,
who never knew the significance of these instincts, are,
by a sort of false instinct, found clinging to the shells.
Those who have no knowledge of the divine appoint
themselves defenders of the divine, as champions of the
church, etc. I have been astonished to observe how
long some audiences can endure to hear a man speak
on a subject which he knows nothing about, as religion
for instance, when one who has no ear for music might
with the same propriety take up the time of a musical
assembly with putting through his opinions on music.
This young man who is the main pillar of some divine
institution,—does he know what he has undertaken?
If the saints were to come again on earth, would they
be likely to stay at his house? would they meet with his
approbation even? <i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</i> They who
merely have a talent for affairs are forward to express
their opinions. A Roman soldier sits there to decide upon
the righteousness of Christ. The world does not long
endure such blunders, though they are made every day.
The weak-brained and pusillanimous farmers would
fain abide by the institutions of their fathers. Their
argument is they have not long to live, and for that little
space let them not be disturbed in their slumbers; blessed
are the peacemakers; let this cup pass from me, etc.

new fountains flowed into it at the upper. A

The grass in the high pastures is almost as dry as
hay. The seasons do not cease a moment to revolve, and
therefore Nature rests no longer at her culminating
point than at any other. If you are not out at the right
instant, the summer may go by and you not see it. How
much of the year is spring and fall! how little can be
called summer! The grass is no sooner grown than it
begins to wither. How much Nature herself suffers
from drought! It seems quite as much as she can do to
produce these crops.

I hear a cricket in the Depot Field, walk a rod or two,
and find the note proceeds from near a rock. Partly
under a rock, between it and the roots of the grass, he
lies concealed,—for I pull away the withered grass with
my hands,—uttering his night-like creak, with a vibratory
motion of his wings, and flattering himself that it is
night, because he has shut out the day. He was a black
fellow nearly an inch long, with two long, slender feelers.
They plainly avoid the light and hide their heads in the
grass. At any rate they regard this as the evening of
the year. They are remarkably secret and unobserved,
considering how much noise they make. Every milkman
has heard them all his life; it is the sound that fills his
ears as he drives along. But what one has ever got off his
cart to go in search of one? I see smaller ones moving
stealthily about, whose note I do not know. Who ever
distinguished their various notes, which fill the crevices
in each other’s song? It would be a curious ear, indeed,
that distinguished the species of the crickets which it
heard, and traced even the earth-song home, each part
to its particular performer. I am afraid to be so knowing.
They are shy as birds, these little bodies. Those nearest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
me continually cease their song as I walk, so that the
singers are always a rod distant, and I cannot easily
detect one. It is difficult, moreover, to judge correctly
whence the sound proceeds. Perhaps this wariness is
necessary to save them from insectivorous birds, which
would otherwise speedily find out so loud a singer.
They are somewhat protected by the universalness of
the sound, each one’s song being merged and lost in the
general concert, as if it were the creaking of earth’s
axle. They are very numerous in oats and other grain,
which conceals them and yet affords a clear passage. I
never knew any drought or sickness so to prevail as to
quench the song of the crickets; it fails not in its season,
night or day.

How copious and precise the botanical language to
describe the leaves, as well as the other parts of a plant!
Botany is worth studying if only for the precision of its
terms,—to learn the value of words and of system. It
is wonderful how much pains has been taken to describe
a flower’s leaf, compared for instance with the care that
is taken in describing a psychological fact. Suppose as
much ingenuity (perhaps it would be needless) in making
a language to express the sentiments! We are armed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
with language adequate to describe each leaf in the field,
or at least to distinguish it from each other, but not to
describe a human character. With equally wonderful
indistinctness and confusion we describe men. The precision
and copiousness of botanical language applied to
the description of moral qualities!

I see cardinal-flowers, with their red artillery, reminding
me of soldiers,—red men, war, and bloodshed. Some
are four and a half feet high. Thy sins shall be as
scarlet. Is it my sins that I see? It shows how far a little
color can go; for the flower is not large, yet it makes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
itself seen from afar, and so answers the purpose for
which it was colored completely. It is remarkable for
its intensely brilliant scarlet color. You are slow to concede
to it a high rank among flowers, but ever and anon,
as you turn your eyes away, it dazzles you and you pluck
it. <i>Scutellaria lateriflora</i>, side-flowering skullcap, here.
This brook deserves to be called Clematis Brook
(though that name is too often applied), for the clematis
is very abundant, running over the alders and other
bushes on its brink. Where the brook issues from the
pond, the nightshade grows profusely, spreading five
or six feet each way, with its red berries now ripe. It
grows, too, at the upper end of the pond. But if it is the
button-bush that grows in the now low water, it should
rather be called the Button-Bush Pond. Now the tall
rush is in its prime on the shore here, and the clematis
abounds by this pond also.

On the pitch pine plain, at first the pines are far

<i>Aug. 21.</i> To a great extent the feudal system still
prevails there (in Canada), and I saw that I should be
a bad citizen, that any man who thought for himself
and was only reasonably independent would naturally
be a rebel. You could not read or hear of their laws
without seeing that it was a legislating for a few and
not for all. That certainly is the best government where
the inhabitants are least often reminded of the government.
(Where a man cannot be a poet even without
danger of being made poet-laureate! Where he cannot
be healthily neglected, and grow up a man, and not an
Englishman merely!) Where it is the most natural thing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span>
in the world for a government that does not understand
you, to let you alone. Oh, what a government were
there, my countrymen! It is a government, that English
one,—and most other European ones,—that
cannot afford to be forgotten, as you would naturally
forget them, that cannot let you go alone, having learned
to walk. It appears to me that a true Englishman can
only speculate within bounds; he has to pay his respects
to so many things that before he knows it he has paid
all he is worth. The principal respect in which our government
is more tolerable is in the fact that there is so
much less of government with us. In the States it is
only once in a dog’s age that a man need remember his
government, but here he is reminded of it every day.

What a faculty must that be which can paint the
most barren landscape and humblest life in glorious
colors! It is pure and invigorated senses reacting on
a sound and strong imagination. Is not that the poet’s
case? The intellect of most men is barren. They
neither fertilize nor are fertilized. It is the marriage of
the soul with Nature that makes the intellect fruitful,
that gives birth to imagination. When we were dead
and dry as the highway, some sense which has been
healthily fed will put us in relation with Nature, in sympathy
with her; some grains of fertilizing pollen, floating
in the air, fall on us, and suddenly the sky is all
one rainbow, is full of music and fragrance and flavor.
The man of intellect only, the prosaic man, is a barren,

As is a man’s intellectual character, is not such his

strength, which the most passive endurance? Methinks
I could to some extent infer these things.

Bigelow, speaking of the spikes of the blue vervain
(<i>Verbena hastata</i>), says, “The flowering commences
at their base and is long in reaching their summit.”
I perceive that only one circle of buds, about half a
dozen, blossoms at a time,—and there are about thirty
circles in the space of three inches,—while the next
circle of buds above at the same time shows the blue.
Thus this triumphant blossoming circle travels upward,
driving the remaining buds off into space.<a name='FA_299' id='FA_299' href='#FN_299' class='fnanchor'>[299]</a> I think it
was the 16th of July when I first noticed them (on
another plant), and now they are all within about half
an inch of the top of the spikes. Yet the blossoms have
got no nearer the top on long [<i>sic</i>] spikes, which had
many buds, than on short ones only an inch long. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
the blossoming commenced enough earlier on the
long ones to make up for the difference in length. It is

this and similar clocks. So you get, not the absolute
time, but the true time of the season.<a name='FA_300' id='FA_300' href='#FN_300' class='fnanchor'>[300]</a> But I can measure
the progress of the seasons only by observing a
particular plant, for I notice that they are by no means
equally advanced.
</p>

<p>
The prevailing conspicuous flowers at present are:
The early goldenrods, tansy, the life-everlastings, flea-bane
(though not for its flower), yarrow (rather dry),
hardhack and meadow-sweet (both getting dry, also
mayweed), <i>Eupatorium purpureum</i>, scabish, clethra
(really a fine, sweet-scented, and this year particularly
fair and fresh, flower, some unexpanded buds at top
tinged with red), Rhexia Virginica, thoroughwort, <i>Polygala
sanguinea</i>, prunella, and dog’s-bane (getting stale),
etc., etc. Touch-me-not (less observed), Canada snapdragon
by roadside (not conspicuous). The purple
gerardia now, horsemint, or <i>Mentha borealis</i>, <i>Veronica
scutellata</i> (marsh speedwell), <i>Ranunculus acris</i> (tall crowfoot)
still. Mowing to some extent improves the landscape
to the eye of the walker. The aftermath, so fresh
and green, begins now to recall the spring to my mind.
In some fields fresh clover heads appear. This is certainly
better than fields of lodged and withered grass. I
find ground-nuts by the railroad causeway three quarters
of an inch long by a third of an inch. The epilobium
still. Cow-wheat (<i>Melampyrum Americanum</i>) still flourishes
as much if not more than ever, and, shrubby-looking,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
helps cover the ground where the wood has
recently been cut off, like huckleberry bushes.
</p>

<p>
There is some advantage, intellectually and spiritually,
in taking wide views with the bodily eye and not
pursuing an occupation which holds the body prone.
There is some advantage, perhaps, in attending to the
general features of the landscape over studying the
particular plants and animals which inhabit it. A man
may walk abroad and no more see the sky than if he
walked under a shed. The poet is more in the air than
the naturalist, though they may walk side by side.
Granted that you are out-of-doors; but what if the
outer door <i>is</i> open, if the inner door is shut! You must
walk sometimes perfectly free, not prying nor inquisitive,
not bent upon seeing things. Throw away a whole
day for a single expansion, a single inspiration of air.
</p>

<p>
Any anomaly in vegetation makes Nature seem more
real and present in her working, as the various red and
yellow excrescences on young oaks. I am affected as
if it were a different Nature that produced them. As if
a poet were born who had designs in his head.<a name='FA_301' id='FA_301' href='#FN_301' class='fnanchor'>[301]</a>

<p>
It is remarkable that animals are often obviously,
manifestly, related to the plants which they feed upon
or live among,—as caterpillars, butterflies, tree-toads,
partridges, chewinks,—and this afternoon I noticed
a yellow spider on a goldenrod; as if every condition
might have its expression in some form of animated
being.<a name='FA_302' id='FA_302' href='#FN_302' class='fnanchor'>[302]</a>

Spear-leaved goldenrod in path to northeast of Flint’s
Pond. <i>Hieracium paniculatum</i>, a very delicate and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
slender hawkweed. I have now found all the hawkweeds.
Singular these genera of plants, plants manifestly related
yet distinct. They suggest a history to nature, a
natural <i>history</i> in a new sense.<a name='FA_303' id='FA_303' href='#FN_303' class='fnanchor'>[303]</a>

<p>
At Wharf Rock found water lobelia in blossom. I
saw some smilax vines in the swamp, which were connected
with trees ten feet above the ground whereon
they grew and four or five feet above the surrounding
bushes. This slender vine, which cannot stand erect,
how did it establish that connection? Have the trees
and shrubs by which it once climbed been cut down?
Or perchance do the young and flexible shoots blow
up in high winds and fix themselves?<a name='FA_304' id='FA_304' href='#FN_304' class='fnanchor'>[304]</a> On Cedar Hill,
south side pond, I still hear the locust, though it has
been so much colder for the last week. It is quite hazy
in the west, though comparatively clear in other directions.
The barberry bushes, with their drooping wreaths
of fruit now turning red, bushed up with some other
shrub or tree.

<i>Aug. 22.</i> I found last winter that it was expected by
my townsmen that I would give some account of Canada
because I had <i>visited</i> it, and because many of them had,
and so felt interested in the subject,—visited it as the
bullet visits the wall at which it is fired, and from which
it rebounds as quickly, and flattened (somewhat damaged,
perchance)! Yes, a certain man contracted to take
fifteen hundred live Yankees through Canada, at a certain
rate and within a certain time. It did not matter
to him what the commodity was, if only it would pack
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
well and were delivered to him according to agreement
at the right place and time and rightly ticketed, so
much in bulk, wet or dry, on deck or in the hold, at the
option of the carrier how to stow the cargo and not always
right side up. In the meanwhile, it was understood
that the freight was not to be willfully and intentionally
debarred from seeing the country if it had eyes. It was
understood that there would be a country to be seen on
either side, though that was a secret advantage which
the contractors seemed not to be aware of. I fear that I
have not got much to say, not having seen much, for the
very rapidity of the motion had a tendency to keep my
eyelids closed. What I <i>got</i> by going to Canada was a
cold, and not till I get a fever, which I never had, shall
I know how to appreciate it.<a name='FA_305' id='FA_305' href='#FN_305' class='fnanchor'>[305]</a>

It is the fault of some excellent writers—De Quincey’s
first impressions on seeing London suggest it to
me—that they express themselves with too great fullness
and detail. They give the most faithful, natural,
and lifelike account of their sensations, mental and
physical, but they lack moderation and sententiousness.
They do not affect us by an ineffectual earnestness and
a reserve of meaning, like a stutterer; they say all they
mean. Their sentences are not concentrated and nutty.
Sentences which suggest far more than they say, which
have an atmosphere about them, which do not merely
report an old, but make a new, impression; sentences
which suggest as many things and are as durable as a
Roman aqueduct; to frame these, that is the art of
writing. Sentences which are expensive, towards which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' name='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
so many volumes, so much life, went; which lie like
boulders on the page, up and down or across; which
contain the seed of other sentences, not mere repetition,
but creation; which a man might sell his grounds and
castles to build. If De Quincey had suggested each of
his pages in a sentence and passed on, it would have
been far more excellent writing. His style is nowhere
kinked and knotted up into something hard and significant,
which you could swallow like a diamond, without
digesting.<a name='FA_306' id='FA_306' href='#FN_306' class='fnanchor'>[306]</a>

<i>Aug. 23. Saturday.</i> To Walden to bathe at 5.30
<span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Traces of the heavy rains in the night. The sand
and gravel are beaten hard by them. Three or four
showers in succession. But the grass is not so wet as
after an ordinary dew. The <i>Verbena hastata</i> at the pond
has reached the top of its spike, a little in advance of
what I noticed yesterday; only one or two flowers are
adhering. At the commencement of my walk I saw no
traces of fog, but after detected fogs over particular
meadows and high up some brooks’ valleys, and far
in the Deep Cut the wood fog. First muskmelon this
morning.
</p>

<p>
I rarely pass the shanty in the woods, where human
beings are lodged, literally, no better than pigs in a sty,—little
children, a grown man and his wife, and an
aged grandmother living this squalid life, squatting on
the ground,—but I wonder if it can be indeed true
that little Julia Riordan calls this place home, comes
here to rest at night and for her daily food,—in whom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
ladies and gentlemen in the village take an interest.
Of what significance are charity and almshouses? That
there they live unmolested! in one sense so many degrees
below the almshouse! beneath charity! It is
admirable,—Nature against almshouses. A certain
wealth of nature, not poverty, it suggests. Not to identify
health and contentment, aye, and independence, with
the possession of this world’s goods! It is not wise to
waste compassion on them.
</p>

<p>
As I go through the Deep Cut, I hear one or two early
humblebees, come out on the damp sandy bank, whose
low hum sounds like distant horns from far in the horizon
over the woods. It was long before I detected the
bees that made it, so far away and musical it sounded,
like the shepherds in some distant eastern vale greeting
the king of day.<a name='FA_307' id='FA_307' href='#FN_307' class='fnanchor'>[307]</a>

I sometimes reproach myself because I do not find
anything attractive in certain mere trivial employments
of men,—that I skip men so commonly, and their
affairs,—the professions and the trades,—do not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
elevate them at least in my thought and get some material
for poetry out of them directly. I will not avoid,
then, to go by where these men are repairing the stone
bridge,—see if I cannot see poetry in that, if that will
not yield me a reflection. It is narrow to be confined to
woods and fields and grand aspects of nature only. The
greatest and wisest will still be related to men. Why not
see men standing in the sun and casting a shadow, even
as trees? May not some light be reflected from them as
from the stems of trees? I will try to enjoy them as animals,
at least. They are perhaps better animals than
men. Do not neglect to speak of men’s low life and
affairs with sympathy, though you ever so speak as to
suggest a contrast between them and the ideal and
divine. You may be excused if you are always pathetic,
but do not refuse to recognize.

Resolve to read no book, to take no walk, to undertake
no enterprise, but such as you can endure to give
an account of to yourself. Live thus deliberately for the
most part.

When I stopped to gather some blueberries by the
roadside this afternoon, I heard the shrilling of a cricket
or a grasshopper close to me, quite clear, almost like a
bell, a stridulous sound, a clear ring, incessant, not
intermittent, like the song of the black fellow I caught
the other day, and not suggesting the night, but belonging
to day. It was long before I could find him, though
all the while within a foot or two. I did not know whether
to search amid the grass and stones or amid the leaves.
At last, by accident I saw him, he shrilling all the while
under an alder leaf two feet from the ground,—a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
slender green fellow with long feelers and transparent
wings. When he shrilled, his wings, which opened on
each other in the form of a heart perpendicularly to his
body like the wings of fairies, vibrated swiftly on each
other. The apparently wingless female, as I thought,
was near.

We experience pleasure when an elevated field or even

The Price Farm road, one of those everlasting roads
which the sun delights to shine along in an August afternoon,
playing truant; which seem to stretch themselves
with terrene jest as the weary traveller journeys on;
where there are three white sandy furrows (<i>liræ</i>), two for
the wheels and one between them for the horse, with
endless green grass borders between and room on each
side for huckleberries and birches; where the walls
indulge in freaks, not always parallel to the ruts, and
goldenrod yellows all the path; which some elms began
to border and shade once, but left off in despair, it was
so long; from no point on which can you be said to be
at any definite distance from a town.

Our little river reaches are not to be forgotten. I
noticed that seen northward on the Assabet from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' name='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
Causeway Bridge near the second stone bridge. There
was [a] man in a boat in the sun, just disappearing in the
distance round a bend, lifting high his arms and dipping
his paddle as if he were a vision bound to land of the
blessed,—far off, as in picture. When I see Concord
to purpose, I see it as if it were not real but painted, and
what wonder if I do not speak to <i>thee</i>? I saw a snake by
the roadside and touched him with my foot to see if he
were alive. He had a toad in his jaws, which he was preparing
to swallow with his jaws distended to three times
his width, but he relinquished his prey in haste and fled;
and I thought, as the toad jumped leisurely away with
his slime-covered hind-quarters glistening in the sun, as
if I, his deliverer, wished to interrupt his meditations,—without
a shriek or fainting,—I thought what a
healthy indifference he manifested. Is not this the broad

The weather is warmer again after a week or more of
cool days. There is greater average warmth, but not
such intolerable heats as in July. The nights especially
are more equably warm now, even when the day has
been comparatively rather cool. There are few days
now, fewer than in July, when you cannot lie at your
length on the grass. You have now forgotten winter

Rattlesnake grass is ripe. The pods of the <i>Asclepias

of the <i>Asclepias Syriaca</i> hang down. The interregnum
in the blossoming of flowers being <i>well</i>
over, many small flowers blossom now in the low
grounds, having just reached their summer. It is now
dry enough, and they feel the heat their tenderness required.
The autumnal flowers,—goldenrods, asters,

have not yet commenced to reign. The tansy is

<i>Aug. 26.</i> A cool and even piercing wind blows to-day,
making all shrubs to bow and trees to wave; such as
we could not have had in July. I speak not of its coolness
but its strength and steadiness. The wind and the
coldness increased as the day advanced, and finally the
wind went down with the sun. I was compelled to put
on an extra coat for my walk. The ground is strewn
with windfalls, and much fruit will consequently be lost.

The wind roars amid the pines like the surf. You can
hardly hear the crickets for the din, or the cars. I think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' name='Page_426' href='#Page_426'>426</a></span>
the last must be considerably delayed when their course
is against it. Indeed it is difficult to enjoy a quiet
thought. You sympathize too much with the commotion
and restlessness of the elements. Such a blowing,
stirring, bustling day,—what does it mean? All light
things decamp; straws and loose leaves change their
places. Such a blowing day is no doubt indispensable
in the economy of nature. The whole country is a seashore,
and the wind is the surf that breaks on it. It
shows the white and silvery under sides of the leaves.
Do plants and trees need to be thus tried and twisted?
Is it a first intimation to the sap to cease to ascend, to
thicken their stems? The <i>Gerardia pedicularia</i>, bushy
gerardia, I find on the White Pond road.

<p>
I perceive that some farmers are cutting turf now.
They require the driest season of the year. There is
something agreeable to my thoughts in thus burning a
part of the earth, the stock of fuel is so inexhaustible.
Nature looks not mean and niggardly, but like an ample
loaf. Is not he a rich man who owns a peat meadow?
It is to enjoy the luxury of wealth. It must be a luxury
to sit around the fire in winter days and nights and burn
these dry slices of the meadow which contain roots of
all herbs. You dry and burn the very earth itself. It is
a fact kindred with salt-licks. The meadow is strewn
with the fresh bars, bearing the marks of the fork, and
the turf-cutter is wheeling them out with his barrow.
To sit and see the world aglow and try to imagine how
it would seem to have it so destroyed!

I find three or four ordinary laborers to-day putting
up the necessary outdoor fixtures for a magnetic telegraph
from Boston to Burlington. They carry along
a basket full of simple implements, like travelling
tinkers, and, with a little rude soldering, and twisting,
and straightening of wires, the work is done. It is a
work which seems to admit of the greatest latitude of
ignorance and bungling, and as if you might set your
hired man with the poorest head and hands to building
a magnetic telegraph. All great inventions stoop thus
low to succeed, for the understanding is but little above
the feet. They preserve so low a tone; they are simple
almost to coarseness and commonplaceness. Somebody
had told them what he wanted, and sent them
forth with a coil of wire to make a magnetic telegraph.
It seems not so wonderful an invention as a common
cart or a plow.

Those who first built it, coming from old France,
with the memory and tradition of feudal days and customs
weighing on them, were unquestionably behind
their age, and those who now inhabit it and repair it

of Boston should go down to Fort Independence, or
the inhabitants of New York should go over to Castle
William, to live. I rubbed my eyes to be sure that I was
in the Nineteenth Century. That would be a good
place to read Froissart’s Chronicles, I thought. It is a
specimen of the Old World in the New. It is such

<i>Aug. 30. Saturday.</i> I perceive in the Norway cinquefoil
(<i>Potentilla Norvegica</i>), now nearly out of blossom,
that the alternate five leaves of the calyx are closing
over the seeds to protect them. This evidence of
forethought, this simple <i>reflection</i> in a double sense
of the term, in this flower, is affecting to me, as if it
said to me: “Even I am doing my appointed work in
this world faithfully. Not even do I, however obscurely
I may grow among the other loftier and more famous
plants, shirk my work, humble weed as I am. Not even
when I have blossomed, and have lost my painted petals
and am preparing to die down to my root, do I forget
to fall with my arms around my babe, faithful to the
last, that the infant may be found preserved in the
arms of the frozen mother.” That thus all the Norway
cinquefoils in the world had curled back their calyx
leaves, their warm cloaks, when now their flowering
season was past, over their progeny, from the time they
were created! There is one door closed, of the closing
year. Nature ordered this bending back of the calyx
leaves, and every year since this plant was created her
order has been faithfully obeyed, and this plant acts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' name='Page_431' href='#Page_431'>431</a></span>
not an obscure, but essential, part in the revolution of
the seasons. I am not ashamed to be contemporary
with the Norway cinquefoil. May I perform my part as
well!<a name='FA_318' id='FA_318' href='#FN_318' class='fnanchor'>[318]</a> There is so much done toward closing up the
year’s accounts. It is as good as if I saw the great globe
go round. It is as if I saw the Janus doors of the year
closing. The fall of each humblest flower marks the
annual period of some phase of human life, experience.
I can be said to note the flower’s fall only when I see
in it the symbol of my own change. When I experience
this, then the flower appears to me.
</p>

<p>
<i>Drosera rotundifolia</i> in Moore’s new field ditch.
The <i>Viola pedata</i> and the houstonia now. What is the
peculiarity of these flowers that <i>they</i> blossom again?
Is it merely because they blossomed so early in the
spring, and now are ready for a new spring? They
impress me as so much more native or naturalized
here.
</p>

<p>
We love to see Nature fruitful in whatever kind.
It assures us of her vigor and that she may equally
bring forth the fruits which we prize. I love to see the
acorns plenty, even on the shrub oaks, aye, and the
nightshade berries. I love to see the potato balls numerous
and large, as I go through a low field, poisonous
though they look, the plant thus, as it were, bearing
fruit at both ends, saying ever and anon, “Not only
these tubers I offer you for the present, but if you will
have new varieties,—if these do not satisfy you,—plant
these seeds.”<a name='FA_319' id='FA_319' href='#FN_319' class='fnanchor'>[319]</a> What abundance! what luxuriance!
what bounty! The potato balls, which are worthless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' name='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
to the farmer, combine to make the general impression
of the year’s fruitfulness. It is as cheering to me
as the rapid increase of the population of New York.

<p class="p2">
<i>Aug. 31.</i> <i>Proserpinaca palustris</i>, spear-leaved proserpinaca,
mermaid-weed. (This in Hubbard’s Grove
on my way to Conantum.) A hornets’ (?) nest in a
rather tall huckleberry bush, the stems projecting
through it, the leaves spreading over it. How these
fellows avail themselves of the vegetables! They kept
arriving, the great fellows, but I never saw whence they
came, but only heard the buzz just at the entrance.
(With whitish abdomens.) At length, after I have
stood before the nest five minutes, during which time
they had taken no notice of me, two seemed to be consulting
at the entrance, and then one made a threatening
dash at me and returned to the nest. I took the hint
and retired. They spoke as plainly as man could have
done.<a name='FA_320' id='FA_320' href='#FN_320' class='fnanchor'>[320]</a>

have not observed much St. John’s-wort yet. <i>Galium

wood as from night into day. Having forgotten the
daylight, I was surprised to see how bright it was. I
had light enough, methought, and here was an afternoon
sun illumining all the landscape. It was a surprise to
me to see how much brighter an ordinary afternoon is
than the light which penetrates a thick wood.

What right has a New England poet to sing of wine,
who never saw a vineyard, who obtains his liquor from
the grocer, who would not dare, if he could, tell him what
it is composed of. A Yankee singing in praise of wine!
It is not sour grapes in this case, it is sweet grapes;
the more inaccessible they are the sweeter they are. It
seemed to me that the year had nothing so much to
brag of as these potato balls. Do they not concern New-Englanders
a thousand times more than all her grapes?

Cohush now in fruit, ivory-white berries tipped <i>now</i>
with black on stout red pedicels,—<i>Actæa alba</i>. <i>Collinsonia
Canadensis</i>, horseweed. I had discovered this
singular flower there new to me, and, having a botany
by me, looked it out. What a surprise and disappointment,
what an insult and impertinence to my curiosity
and expectation, to have given me the name “horseweed!”
</p>

<p>
Cohush Swamp is about twenty rods by three or four.
Among rarer plants it contains the basswood, the black
(as well as white) ash, the fever-bush, the cohush, the
collinsonia, not to mention sassafras, poison sumach,
ivy, agrimony, <i>Arum triphyllum</i>, (sweet viburnum (?)
in hedges near by), ground-nut, touch-me-not (as high
as your head), and <i>Eupatorium purpureum</i> (eight feet,
eight inches high, with a large convex corymb (hemispherical)
of many stories, fourteen inches wide; width
of plant from tip of leaf to tip of leaf two feet, diameter
of stalk one inch at ground, leaves seven in a whorl).
Rare plants seem to love certain localities. As if the
original Conant had been a botanist and endeavored
to form an arboretum. A natural arboretum?

It was the filiform crowfoot (<i>Ranunculus filiformis</i>)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' name='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
that I saw by the riverside the other day and to-day.
The season advances apace. The flowers of the nettle-leaved
vervain are now near the ends of the spike, like
the blue. <i>Utricularia inflata</i>, whorled bladderwort,
floating on the water at same place. <i>Gentiana Saponaria</i>
budded. <i>Gerardia flava</i> at Conant’s Grove.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour before sunset I was at Tupelo Cliff,
when, looking up from my botanizing (I had been
examining the <i>Ranunculus filiformis</i>, the <i>Sium latifolium</i>
(? ?), and the obtuse galium on the muddy
shore), I saw the seal of evening on the river. There
was a quiet beauty in the landscape at that hour which
my senses were prepared to appreciate. The sun going
down on the west side, that hand being already in shadow
for the most part, but his rays lighting up the water and
the willows and pads even more than before. His rays
then fell at right angles on their stems. I sitting on the
old brown geologic rocks, their feet submerged and
covered with weedy moss (utricularia roots?). Sometimes
their tops are submerged. The cardinal-flowers
standing by me. The trivialness of the day is past. The
greater stillness, the <i>serenity</i> of the air, its coolness and
transparency, the mistiness being condensed, are favorable
to thought. (The pensive eve.) The coolness of
evening comes to condense the haze of noon and make
the air transparent and the outline of objects firm and
distinct, and chaste (chaste eve); even as I am made
more vigorous by my bath, am more <i>continent</i> of thought.
After bathing, even at noonday, a man realizes a morning
or evening life.<a name='FA_323' id='FA_323' href='#FN_323' class='fnanchor'>[323]</a> The evening air is such a bath
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' name='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
for both mind and body. When I have walked all day
in vain under the torrid sun, and the world has been all
trivial,—as well field and wood as highway,—then
at eve the sun goes down westward, and the wind goes
down with it, and the dews begin to purify the air and
make it transparent, and the lakes and rivers acquire
a glassy stillness, reflecting the skies, the reflex of the
day. I too am at the top of my condition for perceiving
beauty. Thus, long after feeding, the diviner faculties
begin to be fed, to feel their oats, their nutriment, and
are not oppressed by the belly’s load. It is abstinence
from loading the belly anew until the brain and divine
faculties have felt their vigor. Not till some hours does
my food invigorate my brain,—ascendeth into the brain.
We practice at this hour an involuntary abstinence.
We are comparatively chaste and temperate as Eve
herself; the nutriment is just reaching the brain. Every
sound is music now. The grating of some distant boat
which a man is launching on the rocky bottom,—though
here is no man nor inhabited house, nor even
cultivated field, in sight,—this is heard with such distinctness
that I listen with pleasure as if it was [<i>sic</i>]
music. The attractive point is that line where the water
meets the land, not distinct, but known to exist. The
willows are not the less interesting because of their
nakedness below. How rich, like what we love to read
of South American primitive forests, is the scenery of
this river! What luxuriance of weeds, what depth of mud
along its sides! These old antehistoric, geologic, antediluvian
rocks, which only primitive wading birds, still
lingering among us, are worthy to tread. The season
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
which we seem to <i>live</i> in anticipation of is arrived. The
water, indeed, reflects heaven because my mind does;
such is its own serenity, its transparency and stillness.
</p>

<p>
With what sober joy I stand to let the water drip from
me and feel my fresh vigor, who have been bathing in
the same tub which the muskrat uses! Such a medicated
bath as only nature furnishes. A fish leaps, and the
dimple he makes is observed now. How ample and
generous was nature! My inheritance is not narrow.<a name='FA_324' id='FA_324' href='#FN_324' class='fnanchor'>[324]</a>
Here is no other this evening. Those resorts which I
most love and frequent, numerous and vast as they are,
are as it were given up to me, as much as if I were
an autocrat or owner of the world, and by my edicts
excluded men from my territories. Perchance there is
some advantage here not enjoyed in older countries.
There are said to be two thousand inhabitants in Concord,
and yet I find such ample space and verge, even
miles of walking every day in which I do not meet nor
see a human being, and often not very recent traces of
them. So much of man as there is in your mind, there
will be in your eye. Methinks that for a great part of the
time, as much as it is possible, I walk as one possessing
the advantages of human culture, fresh from society of
men, but turned loose into the woods, the only man in
nature, walking and meditating to a great extent as if
man and his customs and institutions were not. The
catbird, or the jay, is sure of the whole of your ear now.
Each noise is like a stain on pure glass. The rivers now,
these great blue subterranean heavens, reflecting the
supernal skies and red-tinted clouds.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' name='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>

<p>
A fly (or gnat?) will often buzz round you and persecute
you like an imp. How much of imp-like, pestering
character they express! (I hear a boy driving home his
cows.) What unanimity between the water and the
sky!—one only a little denser element than the other.
The grossest part of heaven. Think of a mirror on so
large a scale! Standing on distant hills, you see the
heavens reflected, the evening sky, in some low lake or
river in the valley, as perfectly as in any mirror they
could be. Does it not prove how intimate heaven is with
earth?
</p>

<p>
We commonly sacrifice to supper this serene and
sacred hour. Our customs turn the hour of sunset to a
trivial time, as at the meeting of two roads, one coming
from the noon, the other leading to the night. It might
be [well] if our repasts were taken out-of-doors, in view
of the sunset and the rising stars; if there were two
persons whose pulses beat together, if men cared for
the κόσμος, or <i>beauty</i> of the world; if men were <i>social</i>
in a high and rare sense; if they associated on high
levels; if we took in with our tea a draught of the transparent,
dew-freighted evening air; if, with our bread
and butter, we took a slice of the red western sky; if the
smoking, steaming urn were the vapor on a thousand
lakes and rivers and meads.
</p>

<p>
The air of the valleys at this hour is the distilled
essence of all those fragrances which during the day
have been filling and have been dispersed in the atmosphere.
The fine fragrances, perchance, which have
floated in the upper atmospheres have settled to these
low vales!

I talked of buying Conantum once, but for want of
money we did not come to terms. But I have farmed it

I have no objection to giving the names of some naturalists,
men of flowers, to plants, if by their lives they
have identified themselves with them. There may be
a few Kalmias. But it must be done very sparingly, or,
rather, discriminatingly, and no man’s name be used
who has not been such a lover of flowers that the flowers
themselves may be supposed thus to reciprocate his
love.

<i>Sept. 1.</i> <i>Mikania scandens</i>, with its purplish white
flowers, now covering the button-bushes and willows
by the side of the stream. <i>Bidens chrysanthemoides</i>,
large-flowered bidens, edge of river. Various-colored

Is not disease the rule of existence? There is not a
lily pad floating on the river but has been riddled by
insects. Almost every shrub and tree has its gall, oftentimes
esteemed its chief ornament and hardly to be distinguished
from the fruit. If misery loves company,
misery has company enough. Now, at midsummer,
find me a perfect leaf or fruit.
</p>

<p>
The fruit of the trilliums is very handsome. I found
some a month ago, a singular <i>red</i>, angular-cased pulp,
drooping, with the old anthers surrounding it three
quarters of an inch in diameter; and now there is
another kind, a dense crowded cluster of many ovoid
berries turning from green to scarlet or bright brick-color.
Then there is the mottled fruit of the clustered
Solomon’s-seal, and also the greenish (with blue meat)
fruit of the <i>Convallaria multiflora</i> dangling from the
axils of the leaves.

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept. 2.</i> The dense fog came into my chamber early
this morning, freighted with light, and woke me. It
was, no doubt, lighter at that hour than if there had
been no fog.
</p>

<p>
Not till after several months does an infant find its
hands, and it may be seen looking at them with astonishment,
holding them up to the light; and so also it
finds its toes. How many faculties there are which we
have never found!<a name='FA_325' id='FA_325' href='#FN_325' class='fnanchor'>[325]</a> Some men, methinks, have found
only their hands and feet. At least I have seen some who
appeared never to have found their heads, but used
them only instinctively, as the negro who butts with his,<a name='FA_326' id='FA_326' href='#FN_326' class='fnanchor'>[326]</a>
or the water-carrier who makes a pack-horse of his.
They have but partially found their heads.
</p>

<p>
We cannot write well or truly but what we write
with gusto. The body, the senses, must conspire with
the mind. Expression is the act of the whole man, that
our speech may be vascular. The intellect is powerless
to express thought without the aid of the heart and
liver and of every member. Often I feel that my head
stands out too dry, when it should be immersed. A
writer, a man writing, is the scribe of all nature; he is
the corn and the grass and the atmosphere writing. It
is always essential that we love to do what we are doing,
do it with a heart. The maturity of the mind, however,
may perchance consist with a certain dryness.
</p>

<p>
There are flowers of thought, and there are leaves
of thought; most of our thoughts are merely leaves, to
which the thread of thought is the stem.

<p>
What affinity is it brings the goldfinch to the sunflower—both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>442</a></span>
yellow—to pick its seeds? Whatever
things I perceive with my entire man, those let me record,
and it will be poetry. The sounds which I hear
with the consent and coincidence of all my senses, these
are significant and musical; at least, they only are
heard.<a name='FA_327' id='FA_327' href='#FN_327' class='fnanchor'>[327]</a>

In a day or two the first message will be conveyed or
transmitted over the magnetic telegraph through this
town, as a thought traverses space, and no citizen of the
town shall be aware of it. The atmosphere is full of
telegraphs equally unobserved. We are not confined to
Morse’s or House’s or Bain’s line.

<p>
Raise some sunflowers to attract the goldfinches, to
feed them as well as your hens. What a broad and
loaded, bounteously filled platter of food is presented

<p>
Here is one of those thick fogs which last well into
the day. While the farmer is concerned about the crops
which his fields bear, I will be concerned about the fertility
of my human farm. I will watch the winds and the
rains as they affect the crop of thought,—the crop of
crops, ripe thoughts, which glow and rustle and fill the
air with fragrance for centuries. Is it a drought? How
long since we had a rain? What is the state of the
springs? Are the low springs high?
</p>

<p>
I now begin to pluck wild apples.
</p>

<p>
The difference is not great between some fruits in
which the worm is always present and those gall fruits
which were produced by the insect.
</p>

<p>
Old Cato says well, “<i>Patremfamilias vendacem, non
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' name='Page_443' href='#Page_443'>443</a></span>
emacem, esse oportet</i>.” These Latin terminations express
better than any English that I know the greediness, as
it were, and tenacity of purpose with which the husbandman
and householder is required to be a seller
and not a buyer,—with mastiff-like tenacity,—these
<i>lipped</i> words, which, like the lips of moose and browsing
creatures, gather in the herbage and twigs with a certain
greed. This termination <i>cious</i> adds force to a word,
like the lips of browsing creatures, which greedily collect
what the jaw holds; as in the word “tenacious”
the first half represents the kind of jaw which holds, the
last the lips which collect. It can only be pronounced
by a certain opening and protruding of the lips; so
“avaricious”. These words express the sense of their
simple roots with the addition, as it were, of a certain
lip greediness. Hence “capacious” and “capacity,”
“emacity.” When these expressive words are used, the
hearer gets something to chew upon. To be a seller with
the tenacity and firmness and steadiness of the jaws
which hold and the greediness of the lips which collect.
The audacious man not only dares, but he greedily
collects more danger to dare. The avaricious man not
only desires and satisfies his desire, but he collects ever
new browse in anticipation of his ever-springing desires.
What is <i>luscious</i> is especially enjoyed by the lips. The
mastiff-mouthed are tenacious. To be a seller with
mastiff-mouthed tenacity of purpose, with moose-lipped
greediness,—ability to browse! To be edacious and
voracious is to be not nibbling and swallowing merely,
but eating and swallowing while the lips are greedily
collecting more food.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' name='Page_444' href='#Page_444'>444</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There is a reptile in the throat of the greedy man
always thirsting and famishing. It is not his own natural
hunger and thirst which he satisfies.
</p>

<p>
The more we know about the ancients, the more we
find that they were like the moderns. When I read
Marcus Cato De Re Rustica, a small treatise or Farmer’s
Manual of those days, fresh from the field of Roman
life, all reeking with and redolent of the life of those
days, containing more indirect history than any of the
histories of Rome of direct,—all of that time but that
time,—<i>here</i> is a simple, direct, pertinent word addressed
to the Romans. And where are <i>the Romans</i>? Rome
and the Romans are commonly a piece of rhetoric. As
if New England had disappeared poetically and there
were left Buel’s “Farmer’s Companion,” or the letters of
Solon Robinson, or a volume of extracts from the <i>New
England Farmer</i>. Though the Romans are no more but
a fable and an ornament of rhetoric, we have here their
<i>New England Farmer</i>, the very manual those Roman
farmers read, speaking as if they were to hear it, its
voice not silenced, as if Rome were still the mistress
of the world,—as fresh as a dripping dish-cloth from
a Roman kitchen.<a name='FA_328' id='FA_328' href='#FN_328' class='fnanchor'>[328]</a> As when you overhaul the correspondence
of a man who died fifty years ago, with like
surprise and feelings you overhaul the manuscripts of the
Roman nation. There exist certain old papers, manuscripts,
either the originals or faithful and trustworthy
old copies of the originals, which were left by the Roman
people. They have gone their way, but these old
papers of all sorts remain. Among them there are some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' name='Page_445' href='#Page_445'>445</a></span>
farm journals, or farm books; just such a collection
of diary and memorandum—as when the cow calved,
and the dimensions, with a plan, of the barn, and how
much paid to Joe Farrar for work done on the farm,
etc., etc.—as you might find in an old farmer’s pocket-book
to-day.
</p>

<p>
Indeed the farmer’s was pretty much the same routine
then as now. Cato says: “Sterquilinium magnum stude
ut habeas. Stercus sedulo conserva, cum exportabis
purgato et comminuito. Per autumnum evehito.”
(Study to have a great dungheap. Carefully preserve
your dung, when you carry it out, make clean work of
it and break it up fine. Carry it out during the autumn.)
Just such directions as you find in the “Farmer’s Almanack”
to-day. It reminds me of what I see going on in
our fields every autumn. As if the farmers of Concord
were obeying Cato’s directions. And Cato but repeated
the maxims of a remote antiquity. Nothing can be more
homely and suggestive of the every-day life of the Roman
agriculturalists, thus supplying the very deficiencies in
what is commonly called Roman history, <i>i. e.</i> revealing
to us the actual life of the Romans, the how they
got their living and what they did from day to day.<a name='FA_329' id='FA_329' href='#FN_329' class='fnanchor'>[329]</a>

They planted <i>rapa</i>, <i>raphanos</i>, <i>milium</i>, and <i>panicum</i>
in low foggy land, <i>ager nebulosus</i>.
</p>

<p>
I see the farmer now—<i>i. e.</i> I shall in autumn—on
every side carting out his manure and sedulously making
his compost-heap, or scattering it over his grass
ground and breaking it up with a mallet; and it reminds
me of Cato’s advice. He died one hundred and fifty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' name='Page_446' href='#Page_446'>446</a></span>
years before Christ.<a name='FA_330' id='FA_330' href='#FN_330' class='fnanchor'>[330]</a> Before Christianity was heard of,
this was done. A Roman family appears to have had a
great supply of tubs and kettles.

A fire in the sitting-room to-day. Walk in the afternoon
by Walden road and railroad to Minn’s place, and
round it to railroad and home. The first coolness is
welcome, so serious and fertile of thought. My skin
contracts, and I become more continent. Carried
umbrellas, it mizzling. As in the night, now in the rain, I
smell the fragrance of the woods. The prunella leaves
have turned a delicate claret or lake color by the roadside.
I am interested in these revolutions as much as in
those of kingdoms. Is there not tragedy enough in the
autumn? Walden seems to be going down at last. The
pines are dead and leaning, red and half upset, about
its shore. Thus, by its rising once in twenty-five years,
perchance, it keeps an open shore, as if the ice had
heaved them over. Found the succory at Minn’s Bridge
on railroad and beyond. Query: May not this and the
tree-primrose and other plants be distributed from
Boston on the rays of the railroads, the seeds mixing
with the grains and all kinds of dirt and being blown
from the passing freight-cars? The feathery-tailed
fruit of the fertile flowers of the clematis conspicuous
now.

The shorn meadows looked of a living green as we
came home at eve, even greener than in spring. The

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept. 3.</i> Why was there never a poem on the cricket?
Its creak seems to me to be one of the most prominent
and obvious facts in the world, and the least heeded.
In the report of a man’s contemplations I look to see
somewhat answering to this sound.<a name='FA_332' id='FA_332' href='#FN_332' class='fnanchor'>[332]</a> When I sat on
Lee’s Cliff the other day (August 29th), I saw a man
working with a horse in a field by the river, carting dirt;
and the horse and his relation to him struck me as very
remarkable. There was the horse, a mere animated
machine,—though his tail was brushing off the flies,—his
whole existence subordinated to the man’s, with no
tradition, perhaps no instinct, in him of independence
and freedom, of a time when he was wild and free,—completely
humanized. No compact made with him
that he should have the Saturday afternoons, or the
Sundays, or any holidays. His independence never
recognized, it being now quite forgotten both by men
and by horses that the horse was ever free. For I am
not aware that there are any wild horses known surely
not to be descended from tame ones. Assisting that man
to pull down that bank and spread it over the meadow;
only keeping off the flies with his tail, and stamping,
and catching a mouthful of grass or leaves from time
to time, on his own account,—all the rest for man.
It seemed hardly worth while that he should be <i>animated</i>
for this. It was plain that the man was not educating
the horse; not trying to develop his nature, but merely
getting work out of him. That mass of animated matter
seemed more completely the servant of man than any
inanimate. For slaves have their holidays; a heaven
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>448</a></span>
is conceded to them, but to the horse none. Now and
forever he is man’s slave. The more I considered, the
more the man seemed akin to the horse; only his was
the stronger will of the two. For a little further on I saw
an Irishman shovelling, who evidently was as much
tamed as the horse. He had stipulated that to a certain
extent his independence be recognized, and yet really
he was but little more independent. I had always instinctively
regarded the horse as a free people somewhere,
living wild. Whatever has not come under the
sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent
men are wild,—not tamed and broken by
society. Now for my part I have such a respect for the
horse’s nature as would tempt me to let him alone; not
to interfere with him,—his walks, his diet, his loves.
But by mankind he is treated simply as if he were an engine
which must have rest and is sensible of pain. Suppose
that every squirrel were made to turn a coffee-mill!
Suppose that the gazelles were made to draw milk-carts!
</p>

<p>
There he was with his tail cut off, because it was in
the way, or to suit the taste of his owner; his mane
trimmed, and his feet shod with iron that he might
wear longer. What is a horse but an animal that has
lost its liberty? What is it but a system of slavery?
and do you not thus by <i>insensible</i> and unimportant degrees
come to human slavery? Has lost its liberty!—and
has man got any more liberty himself for having
robbed the horse, or has he lost just as much of his
own, and become more like the horse he has robbed?
Is not the other end of the bridle in this case, too, coiled
round his own neck? Hence stable-boys, jockeys, all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' name='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
that class that is daily transported by fast horses. There
he stood with his oblong square figure (his tail being
cut off) seen against the water, brushing off the flies
with his tail and stamping, braced back while the man
was filling the cart.<a name='FA_333' id='FA_333' href='#FN_333' class='fnanchor'>[333]</a>

<p>
It is a very remarkable and significant fact that,
though no man is quite well or healthy, yet every one
believes practically that health is the rule and disease the
exception, and each invalid is wont to think himself in
a minority, and to postpone somewhat of endeavor to
another state of existence. But it may be some encouragement
to men to know that in this respect they stand on
the same platform, that disease is, in fact, the <i>rule</i> of
our terrestrial life and the prophecy of a <i>celestial</i> life.
Where is the coward who despairs because he is sick?
Every one may live either the life of Achilles or of Nestor.
Seen in this light, our life with all its diseases will look
healthy, and in one sense the more healthy as it is the
more diseased. Disease is not the accident of the individual,
nor even of the generation, but of life itself. In some
form, and to some degree or other, it is one of the permanent
conditions of life. It is, nevertheless, a cheering
fact that men affirm health unanimously, and esteem
themselves miserable failures. Here was no blunder.
They gave us life on exactly these conditions, and methinks
we shall live it with more heart when we perceive
clearly that these are the terms on which we have it.
Life is a warfare, a struggle, and the diseases of the
body answer to the troubles and defeats of the spirit.
Man begins by quarrelling with the animal in him, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>450</a></span>
the result is immediate disease. In proportion as the
spirit is the more ambitious and persevering, the more
obstacles it will meet with. It is as a seer that man asserts
his disease to be exceptional.<a name='FA_334' id='FA_334' href='#FN_334' class='fnanchor'>[334]</a>

As I went under the new telegraph-wire, I heard it
vibrating like a harp high overhead. It was as the
sound of a far-off glorious life, a supernal life, which
came down to us, and vibrated the lattice-work of this
life of ours.<a name='FA_335' id='FA_335' href='#FN_335' class='fnanchor'>[335]</a>

The melons and the apples seem at once to feed my

<p>
Here comes a laborer from his dinner to resume his
work at clearing out a ditch notwithstanding the rain,
remembering as Cato says, <i>per ferias potuisse fossas
veteres tergeri</i>, that in the holidays old ditches might
have been cleared out. One would think that I were
the paterfamilias come to see if the steward of my farm
has done his duty.
</p>

<p>
The ivy leaves are turning red. Fall dandelions
stand thick in the meadows.
</p>

<p>
How much the Roman must have been indebted to
his agriculture, dealing with the earth, its clods and
stubble, its dust and mire. Their farmer consuls were
their glory, and they well knew the farm to be the
nursery of soldiers. Read Cato to see what kind of legs
the Romans stood on.

<p>
The leaves of the hardhack are somewhat appressed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' name='Page_451' href='#Page_451'>451</a></span>
clothing the stem and showing their downy under sides
like white, waving wands. Is it peculiar to the season,
or the rain,—or the plant?
</p>

<p>
Walk often in drizzly weather, for then the small
weeds (especially if they stand on bare ground), covered
with rain-drops like beads, appear more beautiful
than ever,—the hypericums, for instance. They are
equally beautiful when covered with dew, fresh and
adorned, almost spirited away, in a robe of dewdrops.<a name='FA_336' id='FA_336' href='#FN_336' class='fnanchor'>[336]</a>

As for walking, the inhabitants of large English towns
are confined almost exclusively to their parks and to
the highways. The few footpaths in their vicinities “are
gradually vanishing,” says Wilkinson, “under the encroachments
of the proprietors.” He proposes that the
people’s right to them be asserted and defended and
that they be kept in a passable state at the public expense.
“This,” says he, “would be easily done by means
of asphalt laid upon a good foundation”!!! So much
for walking, and the prospects of walking, in the neighborhood
of English large towns.
</p>

<p>
Think of a man—he may be a genius of some kind—being
confined to a highway and a park for his world
to range in! I should die from mere nervousness at the
thought of such confinement. I should hesitate before
I were born, if those terms could be made known to me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' name='Page_452' href='#Page_452'>452</a></span>
beforehand. Fenced in forever by those green barriers
of fields, where gentlemen are seated! Can they be said
to be inhabitants of this globe? Will they be content to
inhabit heaven thus partially?
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept. 4.</i> 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—A clear and pleasant day after the
rain. Start for Boon’s Pond in Stow with C. Every
sight and sound was the more interesting for the clear
atmosphere. When you are starting away, leaving your
more familiar fields, for a little adventure like a walk,
you look at every object with a traveller’s, or at least
with historical, eyes; you pause on the first bridge,
where an ordinary walk hardly commences, and begin
to observe and moralize like a traveller. It is worth the
while to see your native village thus sometimes, as if you
were a traveller passing through it, commenting on your
neighbors as strangers.<a name='FA_337' id='FA_337' href='#FN_337' class='fnanchor'>[337]</a> We stood thus on Wood’s
Bridge, the first bridge, in the capacity of pilgrims and
strangers to its familiarity, giving it one more chance
with us, though our townsmen who passed may not
have perceived it.
</p>

<p>
There was a pretty good-sized pickerel poised over
the sandy bottom close to the shore and motionless as a
shadow. It is wonderful how they resist the slight current
of our river and remain thus stationary for hours.
He, no doubt, saw us plainly on the bridge,—in the
sunny water, his whole form distinct and his shadow,—motionless
as the steel trap which does not spring
till the fox’s foot has touched it.
</p>

<p>
—— ——’s dog sprang up, ran out, and growled at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_453' name='Page_453' href='#Page_453'>453</a></span>
us, and in his eye I seemed to see the eye of his master.
I have no doubt but that, as is the master, such in
course of time tend to become his herds and flocks as
well as dogs. One man’s oxen will be clever and solid,
another’s mischievous, another’s mangy,—in each
case like their respective owners. No doubt man impresses
his own character on the beasts which he tames
and employs; they are not only humanized, but they
acquire his particular human nature.<a name='FA_338' id='FA_338' href='#FN_338' class='fnanchor'>[338]</a> How much oxen
are like farmers generally, and cows like farmers’
wives! and young steers and heifers like farmers’ boys
and girls! The farmer acts on the ox, and the ox reacts
on the farmer. They do not meet half-way, it is true,
but they do meet at a distance from the centre of each
proportionate to each one’s intellectual power.<a name='FA_339' id='FA_339' href='#FN_339' class='fnanchor'>[339]</a> The
farmer is ox-like in his thought, in his walk, in his

Hosmer’s man was cutting his millet, and his buckwheat
already lay in <i>red</i> piles in the field.

<p>
The first picture we noticed was where the road
turned among the pitch pines and showed the Hadley
house, with the high wooded hill behind with dew and
sun on it, the gracefully winding road path, and a more
distant horizon on the right of the house. Just beyond,
on the left, it was pleasant walking where the road was
shaded by a high hill, as it can be only in the morning.
Even in the morning that additional coolness and early-dawn-like
feeling of a more sacred and earlier season
are agreeable.

</p>

<p>
The lane in front of Tarbell’s house, which is but
little worn and appears to lead nowhere, though it has
so wide and all-engulfing an opening, suggested that
such things might be contrived for effect in laying out
grounds. (Only those things are sure to have the greatest
and best effect, which like this were not contrived for
the sake of effect.) An open path which would suggest
walking and adventuring on it, the going to some
place strange and far away. It would make you think
of or imagine distant places and spaces greater than
the estate.
</p>

<p>
It was pleasant, looking back just beyond, to see a
heavy shadow (made by some high birches) reaching
quite across the road. Light and shadow are sufficient
contrast and furnish sufficient excitement when we are
well.
</p>

<p>
Now we were passing the vale of Brown and Tarbell,
a sunshiny mead pastured by cattle and sparkling with
dew, the sound of crows and swallows heard in the air,
and leafy-columned elms seen here and there shining
with dew. The morning freshness and unworldliness
of that domain!<a name='FA_341' id='FA_341' href='#FN_341' class='fnanchor'>[341]</a> The vale of Tempe and of Arcady
is not farther off than are the conscious lives of men
from their opportunities. Our life is as far from corresponding
to its scenery as we are distant from Tempe
and Arcadia; that is to say, they are far away because
we are far from living natural lives. How absurd it would
be to insist on the vale of Tempe in particular when we
have such vales as we have!

<p>
In the Marlborough road, in the woods, I saw a purple
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' name='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>455</a></span>
streak like a stain on the red pine leaves and sand
under my feet, which I was surprised to find was made
by a dense mass of purple fleas, somewhat like snow-fleas,—a
faint purple stain as if some purple dye had
been spilt. What is that slender pink flower that I
find in the Marlborough road,—smaller than a snapdragon?
The slender stems of grass which hang over
the ruts and horses’ path in this little-frequented road
are so laden with dew that I am compelled to hold a
bush before me to shake it off. The jays scream on
the right and left and are seen flying further off as we
go by.
</p>

<p>
We drink in the meadow at Second Division Brook,
then sit awhile to watch its yellowish pebbles and the
cress (?) in it and other weeds. The ripples cover its
surface like a network and are faithfully reflected on the
bottom. In some places, the sun reflected from ripples
on a flat stone looks like a golden comb. The whole
brook seems as busy as a loom: it is a woof and warp
of ripples; fairy fingers are throwing the shuttle at every
step, and the long, waving brook is the fine product.
The water is wonderfully clear.
</p>

<p>
To have a hut here, and a footpath to the brook! For
roads, I think that a poet cannot tolerate more than a
footpath through the fields; that is wide enough, and
for purposes of winged poesy suffices. It is not for the
muse to speak of cart-paths. I would fain travel by a
footpath round the world.<a name='FA_342' id='FA_342' href='#FN_342' class='fnanchor'>[342]</a> I do not ask the railroads of
commerce, not even the cart-paths of the farmer. Pray,
what other path would you have than a footpath? What
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' name='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
else should wear a path? This is the track of man alone.
What more suggestive to the pensive walker?<a name='FA_343' id='FA_343' href='#FN_343' class='fnanchor'>[343]</a> One
walks in a wheel-track with less emotion; he is at a
greater distance from man; but this footpath was,
perchance, worn by the bare feet of human beings, and
he cannot but think with interest of them.

The grapes, though their leaves are withering and
falling, are yet too sour to eat.

In the summer we lay up a stock of experiences for
the winter, as the squirrel of nuts,—something for
conversation in winter evenings. I love to think then
of the more distant walks I took in summer.<a name='FA_344' id='FA_344' href='#FN_344' class='fnanchor'>[344]</a>

At the powder-mills the carbonic acid gas in the road
from the building where they were making charcoal
made us cough for twenty or thirty rods.
</p>

<p>
Saw some gray squirrels whirling their cylinder by
the roadside. How fitted that cylinder to this animal!
“A squirrel is easily taught to turn his cylinder” might
be a saying frequently applicable. And as they turned,
one leaped over or dodged under another most gracefully
and unexpectedly, with interweaving motions.
It was the circus and menagerie combined. So human
they were, exhibiting themselves.
</p>

<p>
In the Marlborough road, I forgot to say, we brushed
the <i>Polygonum articulatum</i> with its spikes of reddish-white
flowers, a slender and tender plant which loves
the middle of dry and sandy not-much-travelled roads.
To find that the very atoms bloom, that there are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_457' name='Page_457' href='#Page_457'>457</a></span>
flowers we rudely brush against which only the microscope
reveals!

It is wise to write on many subjects, to try many
themes, that so you may find the right and inspiring
one. Be greedy of occasions to express your thought.
Improve the opportunity to draw analogies. There are
innumerable avenues to a perception of the truth. Improve
the suggestion of each object however humble,
however slight and transient the provocation. What
else is there to be improved? Who knows what opportunities
he may neglect? It is not in vain that the mind
turns aside this way or that: follow its leading; apply
it whither it inclines to go. Probe the universe in a
myriad points. Be avaricious of these impulses. You
must try a thousand themes before you find the right
one, as nature makes a thousand acorns to get one oak.
He is a wise man and experienced who has taken many
views; to whom stones and plants and animals and a
myriad objects have each suggested something, contributed
something.<a name='FA_345' id='FA_345' href='#FN_345' class='fnanchor'>[345]</a>

<p>
And now, methinks, this wider wood-path<a name='FA_346' id='FA_346' href='#FN_346' class='fnanchor'>[346]</a> is not
bad, for it admits of society more conveniently. Two
can walk side by side in it in the ruts, aye, and one
more in the horse-track.<a name='FA_347' id='FA_347' href='#FN_347' class='fnanchor'>[347]</a> The Indian walked in single
file, more solitary,—not side by side, chatting as he
went. The woodman’s cart and sled make just the
path two walkers want through the wood.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the powder-mills we watched some fat oxen,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_458' name='Page_458' href='#Page_458'>458</a></span>
elephantine, behemoths,—one Rufus-Hosmer-eyed,
with the long lash and projecting eye-ball.
</p>

<p>
Now past the paper-mills, by the westernmost road
east of the river, the first new ground we’ve reached.
</p>

<p>
Not only the prunella turns <i>lake</i>, but the <i>Hypericum
Virginicum</i> in the hollows by the roadside,—a handsome
blush. A part of the autumnal tints, ripe leaves.
Leaves acquire red blood. Red colors touch our blood,
and excite us as well as cows and geese.
</p>

<p>
And now we leave the road and go through the woods
and swamps toward Boon’s Pond, crossing two or three
roads and by Potter’s house in Stow; still on east of
river. The fruit of the <i>Pyrola rotundifolia</i> in the damp
woods. Larch trees in Stow about the houses. Beyond
Potter’s we struck into the extensive wooded plain
where the ponds are found in Stow, Sudbury, and Marlborough.
Part of it called Boon’s Plain.<a name='FA_348' id='FA_348' href='#FN_348' class='fnanchor'>[348]</a> Boon said to
have lived on or under Bailey’s Hill at west of pond.
Killed by Indians between Boon[’s Pond] and White’s
Pond as he was driving his ox-cart. The oxen ran off to
Marlborough garrison-house. His remains have been
searched for. A sandy plain, a large level tract. The
pond shores handsome enough, but water shallow and
muddy looking. Well-wooded shores. The maples
begin to show red about it. Much fished.
</p>

<p>
Saw a load of sunflowers in a farmers [<i>sic</i>]. Such is
the destiny of this large, coarse flower; the farmers
gather it like pumpkins.
</p>

<p>
Returned by railroad down the Assabet. A potato-field
yellow with wild radish. But no good place to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_459' name='Page_459' href='#Page_459'>459</a></span>
bathe for three miles, Knight’s new dam has so raised
the river. A permanent freshet, as it were, the fluviatile
trees standing dead for fish hawk perches, and the
water stagnant for weeds to grow in. You have only to
dam up a running stream to give it the aspect of a dead
stream, and to some degree restore its primitive wild appearance.
Tracts made inaccessible to man and at the
same time more fertile. Some speculator comes and
dams up the stream below, and lo! the water stands over
all meadows, making impassable morasses and dead
trees for fish hawks,—a wild, stagnant, fenny country,
the last gasp of wildness before it yields to the civilization
of the factory,—to cheer the eyes of the factory
people and educate them. It makes a little wilderness
above the factories.
</p>

<p>
The woodbine now begins to hang red about the
maples and other trees.
</p>

<p>
As I looked back up the stream from near the bridge
(I suppose on the road from Potter’s house to Stow), I
on the railroad, I saw the ripples sparkling in the sun,
reminding me of the sparkling icy fleets which I saw last
winter; and I saw how one corresponded to the other, ice
waves to water ones; the erect ice-flakes were the waves
stereotyped. It was the same sight, the reflection of the
sun sparkling from a myriad slanting surfaces at a distance,
a rippled water surface or a crystallized frozen one.
</p>

<p>
Here crossed the river and climbed the high hills on
the west side. The walnut trees conformed in
their branches to the slope of the hill, <img src="images/i-498.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="Trees" /> being just
as high from the ground on the upper side as on
the lower.

<p>
On all sides now I see and smell the withering leaves
of brush that has been cut to clear the land. I see some
blackened tracts which have been burnt over. It is
remarkable, for it is rare to see the surface of the earth
black. And in the horizon I can see the smokes of several
fires. The farmers improve this season, which is
the driest, their haying being done and their harvest
not begun, to do these jobs,—burn brush, build walls,
dig ditches, cut turf. This is what I find them doing all
over the country now; also topping corn and digging
potatoes.

<p>
Saw quite a flock, for the first time, of goldfinches.

<p>
On the high, round hills in the east and southeast of
Stow,—perchance they are called the Assabet Hills,—rising
directly from the river. They are the highest
I know rising thus. The rounded hills of Stow.
A hill and valley country. Very different from Concord.
</p>

<p>
It had been a warm day, especially warm to the head.
I do not perspire as in the early summer, but am sensible
of the ripening heat, more as if by contact. Suddenly
the wind changed to east, and the atmosphere grew
more and more hazy and thick on that side, obstructing
the view, while it was yet clear in the west. I thought
it was the result of the cooler air from over the sea meeting
and condensing the vapor in the warm air of the
land. That was the haze, or thin, dry fog which some
call smoke. It gradually moved westward and affected
the prospect on that side somewhat. It was a very thin
fog invading all the east. I felt the cool air from the
ocean, and it was very refreshing. I opened my bosom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' name='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
and my mouth to inhale it. Very delicious and invigorating.
</p>

<p>
We sat on the top of those hills looking down on the
new brick ice-house. Where there are several hills near
together, you cannot determine at once which is the
highest, whether the one you are on or the next. So,
when great men are assembled, each yields an uncertain
respect to the other, as if it were not certain whose
crown rose highest.
</p>

<p>
Under the nut trees on these hills, the grass is short
and green as if grazed close by cattle who had stood
there for shade, making a distinct circular yard. Yet,
as there is no dung and the form corresponds so closely
to the tree, I doubt if that can be the cause.
</p>

<p>
On hillside north of river above powder-mills the
<i>Pycnanthemum incanum</i> (mountain mint, calamint)
and the <i>Lespedeza violacea</i>.
</p>

<p>
Saw what I thought a small red dog in the road, which
cantered along over the bridge this side the powder-mills
and then turned into the woods. This decided
me—this turning into the woods—that it was a fox.
The dog of the woods, the dog that is more at home in
the woods than in the roads and fields. I do not often
see a dog turning into the woods.
</p>

<p>
Some large white (?) oak acorns this side the last-named
bridge. A few oaks stand in the pastures still,
great ornaments. I do not see any young ones springing
up to supply their places. Will there be any a hundred
years hence? These are the remnants of the primitive
wood, methinks. We are a young people and have not
learned by experience the consequence of cutting off the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' name='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
forest. One day they will be planted, methinks, and
nature reinstated to some extent.
</p>

<p>
I love to see the yellow knots and their lengthened
stain on the dry, unpainted pitch[?]-pine boards on
barns and other buildings,—the Dugan house, for
instance. The indestructible yellow fat! it fats my eyes
to see it; worthy for art to imitate, telling of branches
in the forest once.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept 5.</i> No doubt, like plants, we are fed through
the atmosphere, and the varying atmospheres of various
seasons of the year feed us variously. How often we are
sensible of being thus fed and invigorated! And all
nature contributes to this aerial diet its food of finest
quality. Methinks that in the fragrance of the fruits I
get a finer flavor, and in beauty (which is appreciated
by sight—the taste and smell of the eye) a finer still.
As Wilkinson says, “the physical man himself is the
builded aroma of the world. This then, at least, is the
office of the lungs—to drink the atmosphere with the
planet dissolved in it.” “What is the import of <i>change
of air</i>, and how each pair of lungs has a <i>native air</i> under
some one dome of the sky.”
</p>

<p>
Wilkinson’s book to some extent realizes what I have
dreamed of,—a return to the primitive analogical and
derivative senses of words. His ability to trace analogies
often leads him to a truer word than more remarkable
writers have found; as when, in his chapter on the human
skin, he describes the papillary cutis as “an encampment
of small conical tents coextensive with the
surface of the body.” The faith he puts in old and current
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' name='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
expressions as having sprung from an instinct
wiser than science, and safely to be trusted if they can
be interpreted. The man of science discovers no world
for the mind of man with all its faculties to inhabit.
Wilkinson finds a <i>home</i> for the imagination, and it is no
longer outcast and homeless. All perception of truth is
the detection of an analogy; we reason from our hands
to our head.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkable that Kalm says in 1748 (being in
Philadelphia): “Coals have not yet been found in Pennsylvania;
but people pretend to have seen them higher
up in the country among the natives. Many people however
agree that they are met with in great quantity
more to the north, near Cape Breton.”
</p>

<p class="p2">
As we grow old we live more coarsely, we relax a
little in our disciplines, and, to some extent, cease to
obey our finest instincts. We are more careless about
our diet and our chastity. But we should be fastidious
to the extreme of sanity.<a name='FA_349' id='FA_349' href='#FN_349' class='fnanchor'>[349]</a> All wisdom is the reward of

Moonlight on Fair Haven Pond seen from the Cliffs.
A sheeny lake in the midst of a boundless forest, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' name='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>
windy surf sounding freshly and wildly in the single
pine behind you; the silence of hushed wolves in the
wilderness, and, as you fancy, moose looking off from
the shore of the lake. The stars of poetry and history
and unexplored nature looking down on the scene. This
is my world now, with a dull whitish mark curving northward
through the forest marking the outlet to the lake.
Fair Haven by moonlight lies there like a lake in the
Maine wilderness in the midst of a primitive forest
untrodden by man. This light and this hour take the
civilization all out of the landscape. Even in villages
dogs bay the moon; in forests like this we listen to hear
wolves howl to Cynthia.
</p>

<p>
Even at this hour in the evening the crickets chirp,
the small birds peep, the wind roars in the wood, as if
it were just before dawn. The moonlight seems to linger
as if it were giving way to the light of coming day.
</p>

<p>
The landscape seen from the slightest elevation by
moonlight is seen remotely, and flattened, as it were,
into mere light and shade, open field and forest, like the
surface of the earth seen from the top of a mountain.
</p>

<p>
How much excited we are, how much recruited, by a
great many particular fragrances! A field of ripening
corn, now at night, that has been topped, with the stalks
stacked up to dry,—an inexpressibly dry, rich, sweet,
ripening scent.<a name='FA_350' id='FA_350' href='#FN_350' class='fnanchor'>[350]</a> I feel as if I were an ear of ripening
corn myself. Is not the whole air then a compound of

<i>Sept. 6.</i> The other afternoon I met Sam H—— walking
on the railroad between the depot and the back
road. It was something quite novel to see him there,
though the railroad there is only a short thoroughfare
to the public road. It then occurred to me that I
had never met Mr. H. on the railroad, though he walks
every day, and moreover that it would be quite impossible
for him to walk on the railroad, such a formalist as
he is, such strait-jackets we weave for ourselves. He
could do nothing that was not sanctioned by the longest
use of men, and as men had voted in all their assemblies
from the first to travel on the public way, he would confine
himself to that. It would no doubt seem to him
very improper, not to say undignified, to walk on the
railroad; and then, is it not forbidden by the railroad
corporations? I was sure he could not keep the railroad,
but was merely using the thoroughfare here which a
thousand pioneers had prepared for him. I stood to see
what he would do. He turned off the rails directly on to
the back road and pursued his walk. A passing train
will never meet him on the railroad causeway. How
much of the life of certain men <i>goes</i> to sustain, to make
respected, the institutions of society. They are the ones
who pay the heaviest tax. Here are certain valuable
institutions which can only be sustained by a wonderful
strain which appears all to come upon certain Spartans
who volunteer. Certain men are always to be found—especially
the children of our present institutions—who
are born with an instinct to perceive them. They
are, in effect, supported by a fund which society possesses
for that end, or they receive a pension and their life
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' name='Page_466' href='#Page_466'>466</a></span>
<i>seems</i> to be a sinecure,—but it is not. The unwritten
laws are the most stringent. They are required to wear
a certain dress. What an array of gentlemen whose sole
employment—and it is no sinecure—is to support
their dignity, and with it the dignity of so many indispensable
institutions!
</p>

<p>
The use of many vegetables—wild plants—for
food, which botanists relate, such as Kalm at Cap aux
Oyes on the St. Lawrence, <i>viz.</i> the sea plantain, sea-rocket,
sweet-gale, etc., etc., making us feel the poorer
at first because we never use them, really advertises us
of our superior riches, and shows to what extremities
men have been driven in times of scarcity. No people
that fare as well as we will grub these weeds out of the
seashore.

2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—To Hapgood’s in Acton direct, returning <i>via</i>
Strawberry Hill and Smith’s Road.
</p>

<p>
The ripening grapes begin to fill the air with their
fragrance. The vervain will hardly do for a clock, for I
perceive that some later and smaller specimens have
not much more than begun to blossom, while most have
done. Saw a tall pear tree by the roadside beyond Harris’s
in front of Hapgood’s. Saw the lambkill (<i>Kalmia
angustifolia</i>) in blossom—a few fresh blossoms at <i>the
ends</i> of the fresh twigs—on Strawberry Hill, beautiful
bright flowers. Apparently a new spring with it, while
seed vessels, apparently of this year, hung dry below.
</p>

<p>
From Strawberry Hill the first, but a very slight,
glimpse of Nagog Pond by standing up on the wall.
That is enough to relate of a hill, methinks, that its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' name='Page_467' href='#Page_467'>467</a></span>
elevation gives you the first sight of some distant lake.
The horizon is remarkably blue with mist this afternoon.
Looking from this hill over Acton, successive valleys
filled with blue mist appear, and divided by darker
lines of wooded hills. The shadows of the elms are
deepened, as if the whole atmosphere were permeated
by floods of ether. Annursnack never looked so well
as now seen from this hill. The ether gives a velvet
softness to the whole landscape. The hills float in it. A
blue veil is drawn over the earth.

<p>
The elecampane (<i>Inula Helenium</i>), with its broad
leaves wrinkled underneath and the remains of sunflower-like
blossoms, in front of Nathan Brooks’s, Acton,
and near J. H. Wheeler’s. <i>Prenanthes alba</i>; this Gray
calls <i>Nabalus albus</i>, white lettuce or rattlesnake-root.
Also I <i>seem</i> (?) to have found <i>Nabalus Fraseri</i>, or lion’s-foot.

<i>Sept. 7.</i> We sometimes experience a mere fullness of
life, which does not find any channels to flow into. We
are stimulated, but to no obvious purpose. I feel myself
uncommonly prepared for <i>some</i> literary work, but I can
select no work. I am prepared not so much for contemplation,
as for forceful expression. I am braced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' name='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
both physically and intellectually. It is not so much the
music as the marching to the music that I feel. I feel
that the juices of the fruits which I have eaten, the
melons and apples, have ascended to my brain and are
stimulating it. They give me a heady force. Now I can
write nervously. Carlyle’s writing is for the most part
of this character.
</p>

<p>
Miss Martineau’s last book is not so bad as the
timidity which fears its influence. As if the popularity
of this or that book would be so fatal, and man would
not still be man in the world. Nothing is so much to be
feared as fear. Atheism may comparatively be popular
with God himself.<a name='FA_352' id='FA_352' href='#FN_352' class='fnanchor'>[352]</a>
</p>

<p>
What shall we say of these timid folk who carry the
principle of thinking nothing and doing nothing and
being nothing to such an extreme? As if, in the absence
of thought, that vast yearning of their natures
for something to fill the vacuum made the least traditionary
expression and shadow of a thought to be clung
to with instinctive tenacity. They atone for their producing
nothing by a brutish respect for something.
They are as simple as oxen, and as guiltless of thought
and reflection. Their reflections are reflected from
other minds. The creature of institutions, bigoted and
a conservatist, can say nothing hearty. He cannot meet
life with life, but only with words. He rebuts you by
avoiding you. He is shocked like a woman.
</p>

<p>
Our ecstatic states, which appear to yield so little
fruit, have this value at least: though in the seasons
when our genius reigns we may be powerless for expression,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_469' name='Page_469' href='#Page_469'>469</a></span>
yet, in calmer seasons, when our talent is
active, the memory of those rarer moods comes to color
our picture and is the permanent paint-pot, as it were,
into which we dip our brush. Thus no life or experience
goes unreported at last; but if it be not solid gold
it is gold-leaf, which gilds the furniture of the mind.
It is an experience of infinite beauty on which we unfailingly
draw, which enables us to exaggerate ever
truly. Our moments of inspiration are not lost though
we have no particular poem to show for them; for those
experiences have left an indelible impression, and we
are ever and anon reminded of them. Their truth subsides,
and in cooler moments we can use them as paint
to gild and adorn our prose. When I despair to sing
them, I will remember that they will furnish me with
paint with which to adorn and preserve the works of
talent one day. They are like a pot of pure ether. They
lend the writer when the moment comes a certain superfluity
of wealth, making his expression to overrun and
float itself. It is the difference between our river, now
parched and dried up, exposing its unsightly and weedy
bottom, and the same when, in the spring, it covers all
the meads with a chain of placid lakes, reflecting the
forests and the skies.
</p>

<p>
We are receiving our portion of the infinite. The
art of life! Was there ever anything memorable written
upon it? By what disciplines to secure the most life,
with what care to watch our thoughts. To observe what
transpires, not in the street, but in the mind and heart
of me! I do not remember any page which will tell me
how to spend this afternoon. I do not so much wish to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_470' name='Page_470' href='#Page_470'>470</a></span>
know how to economize time as how to spend it, by
what means to grow rich, that the day may not have
been in vain.
</p>

<p>
What if one moon has come and gone with its world
of poetry, its weird teachings, its oracular suggestions?
So divine a creature, freighted with hints for me, and I
not use her! One moon gone by unnoticed!! Suppose
you attend to the hints, to the suggestions, which the
moon makes for one month,—commonly in vain,—will
they not be very different from anything in literature
or religion or philosophy?<a name='FA_353' id='FA_353' href='#FN_353' class='fnanchor'>[353]</a>

The scenery, when it is truly seen, reacts on the life
of the seer. How to live. How to get the most life. As
if you were to teach the young hunter how to entrap
his game. How to extract its honey from the flower of
the world. That is my every-day business. I am as
busy as a bee about it. I ramble over all fields on that
errand, and am never so happy as when I feel myself
heavy with honey and wax. I am like a bee searching
the livelong day for the sweets of nature. Do I not impregnate
and intermix the flowers, produce rare and
finer varieties by transferring my eyes from one to another?
I do as naturally and as joyfully, with my own
humming music, seek honey all the day. With what
honeyed thought any experience yields me I take a bee
line to my cell. It is with flowers I would deal. Where
is the flower, there is the honey,—which is perchance
the nectareous portion of the fruit,—there is to be the
fruit, and no doubt flowers are thus colored and painted
to attract and guide the bee. So by the dawning or radiance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' name='Page_471' href='#Page_471'>471</a></span>
of beauty are we advertised where is the honey and
the fruit of thought, of discourse, and of action. We
are first attracted by the beauty of the flower, before
we discover the honey which is a foretaste of the future
fruit. Did not the young Achilles (?) spend his youth
learning how to hunt? The art of spending a day. If
it is possible that we may be addressed, it behooves us
to be attentive. If by watching all day and all night I
may detect some trace of the Ineffable, then will it not
be worth the while to watch? Watch and pray without
ceasing, but not necessarily in sadness. Be of good
cheer. Those Jews were too sad: to another people a
still deeper revelation may suggest only joy. Don’t I
know what gladness is? Is it but the reflex of sadness,
its back side? In the Hebrew gladness, I hear but too
distinctly still the sound of sadness retreating. Give me
a gladness which has never given place to sadness.
</p>

<p>
I am convinced that men are not well employed, that
this is not the way to spend a day. If by patience, if
by watching, I can secure one new ray of light, can feel
myself elevated for an instant upon Pisgah, the world
which was dead prose to me become living and divine,
shall I not watch ever? shall I not be a watchman henceforth?
If by watching a whole year on the city’s walls
I may obtain a communication from heaven, shall I not
do well to shut up my shop and turn a watchman? Can
a youth, a man, do more wisely than to go where his life
is to [be] found? As if I had suffered that to be rumor
which may be verified. We are surrounded by a rich
and fertile mystery. May we not probe it, pry into it,
employ ourselves about it, a little? To devote your life
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' name='Page_472' href='#Page_472'>472</a></span>
to the discovery of the divinity in nature or to the eating
of oysters, would they not be attended with very
different results?

The discoveries which we make abroad are special
and particular; those which we make at home are
general and significant. The further off, the nearer the
surface. The nearer home, the deeper. Go in search
of the springs of life, and you will get exercise enough.
Think of a man’s swinging dumb-bells for his health,
when those springs are bubbling in far-off pastures
unsought by him! The seeming necessity of swinging
dumb-bells proves that he has lost his way.<a name='FA_355' id='FA_355' href='#FN_355' class='fnanchor'>[355]</a>

To watch for, describe, all the divine features which
I detect in Nature.

My profession is to be always on the alert to find
God in nature, to know his lurking-places, to attend all
the oratorios, the operas, in nature.

The mind may perchance be persuaded to act, to
energize, by the action and energy of the body. Any
kind of liquid will fetch the pump.

We all have our states of fullness and of emptiness,
but we overflow at different points. One overflows
through the sensual outlets, another through his heart,
another through his head, and another perchance only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' name='Page_473' href='#Page_473'>473</a></span>
through the higher part of his head, or his poetic faculty.
It depends on where each is tight and open. We can,
perchance, then direct our nutriment to those organs
we specially use.

To Conantum <i>via</i> fields, Hubbard’s Grove, and
grain-field, to Tupelo Cliff and Conantum and returning
over peak same way. 6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
</p>

<p>
I hear no larks sing at evening as in the spring, nor
robins; only a few distressed notes from the robin. In
Hubbard’s grain-field beyond the brook, now the sun
is down. The air is very still. There is a fine sound
of crickets, not loud. The woods and single trees are
heavier masses in the landscape than in the spring.
Night has more allies. The heavy shadows of woods
and trees are remarkable now. The meadows are green
with their second crop. I hear only a tree-toad or song
sparrow singing as in spring, at long intervals. The
Roman wormwood is beginning to yellow-green my
shoes,—intermingled with the blue-curls over the sand
in this grain-field. Perchance some poet likened this
yellow dust to the ambrosia of the gods. The birds
are remarkably silent. At the bridge perceive the bats
are out. And the yet silvery moon, not quite full, is
reflected in the water. The water is perfectly still, and
there is a red tinge from the evening sky in it.
</p>

<p>
The sky is singularly marked this evening. There
are bars or rays of nebulous light springing from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_474' name='Page_474' href='#Page_474'>474</a></span>
western horizon where the sun has disappeared, and
alternating with beautiful blue rays, more blue by far
than any other portion of the sky. These continue to
diverge till they have reached the middle, and then
converge to the eastern horizon, making a symmetrical
figure like the divisions of a muskmelon, not very bright,
yet distinct, though growing less and less bright toward
the east. It was a quite remarkable phenomenon encompassing
the heavens, as if you were to behold the
divisions of a muskmelon thus alternately colored from
within it. A proper vision, a colored mist. The most
beautiful thing in nature is the sun reflected from a
tearful cloud. These white and blue ribs embraced the
earth. The two outer blues much the brightest and
matching one another.
</p>

<p>
You hear the hum of mosquitoes.
</p>

<p>
Going up the road. The sound of the crickets is now
much more universal and loud. Now in the fields I see
the white streak of the neottia in the twilight. The
whip-poor-wills sing far off. I smell burnt land somewhere.
At Tupelo Cliff I hear the sound of singers on
the river, young men and women,—which is unusual
here,—returning from their row. Man’s voice, thus
uttered, fits well the spaces. It fills nature. And, after
all, the singing of men is something far grander than
any natural sound. It is wonderful that men do not
oftener sing in the fields, by day and night. I bathe
at the north side the Cliff, while the moon shines round
the end of the rock. The opposite Cliff is reflected in
the water. Then sit on the south side of the Cliff in the
woods. One or two fireflies. Could it be a glow-worm?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' name='Page_475' href='#Page_475'>475</a></span>
I thought I saw one or two in the air. That is all in this
walk. I hear a whip-poor-will uttering a cluck of suspicion
in my rear. He is suspicious and inquisitive.
The river stretches off southward from me. I see the
sheeny portions of its western shore interruptedly for
a quarter of a mile, where the moonlight is reflected
from the pads, a strong, gleaming light while the water
is lost in the obscurity. I hear the sound from time to
time of a leaping fish, or a frog, or a muskrat, or turtle.
It is even warmer, <i>methinks</i>, than it was in August,
and it is perfectly clear,—the air. I know not how it
is that this universal crickets’ creak should sound thus
regularly intermittent, as if for the most part they fell
in with one another and creaked in time, making a certain
pulsing sound, a sort of breathing or panting of all
nature. You sit twenty feet above the still river; see the
sheeny pads, and the moon, and some bare tree-tops in
the distant horizon. Those bare tree-tops add greatly
to the wildness.
</p>

<p>
Lower down I see the moon in the water as bright as
in the heavens; only the water-bugs disturb its disk;
and now I catch a faint glassy glare from the whole
river surface, which before was simply dark. This is
set in a frame of double darkness on the east, <i>i. e.</i> the
reflected shore of woods and hills and the reality, the
shadow and the substance, bipartite, answering to
each.
</p>

<p>
I see the northern lights over my shoulder, to remind
me of the Esquimaux and that they are still my contemporaries
on this globe, that they too are taking
their walks on another part of the planet, in pursuit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' name='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
of seals, perchance.<a name='FA_356' id='FA_356' href='#FN_356' class='fnanchor'>[356]</a> The stars are dimly reflected in
the water. The path of water-bugs in the moon’s rays
is like ripples of light. It is only when you stand fronting
the sun or moon that you see their light reflected
in the water. I hear no frogs these nights,—bullfrogs
or others,—as in the spring. It is not the season of
sound.
</p>

<p>
At Conantum end, just under the wall. From this
point and at this height I do not perceive any bright or
yellowish light on Fair Haven, but an oily and glass-like
smoothness on its southwestern bay, through a very
slight mistiness. Two or three pines appear to stand in
the moonlit air on this side of the pond, while the enlightened
portion of the water is bounded by the heavy
reflection of the wood on the east. It was so soft and
velvety a light as contained a thousand placid days
sweetly put to rest in the bosom of the water. So looked
the North Twin Lake in the Maine woods. It reminds
me of placid lakes in the mid-noon of Indian summer
days, but yet more placid and civilized, suggesting a
higher cultivation, as the wild ever does, which æons
of summer days have gone to make. Like a summer
day seen far away. All the effects of sunlight, with a
softer tone; and all this stillness of the water and the
air superadded, and the witchery of the hour. What
gods are they that require so fair a vase of gleaming
water to their prospect in the midst of the wild woods
by night? Else why this beauty allotted to night, a
gem to sparkle in the zone of night? They are strange
gods now out; methinks their names are not in any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' name='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
mythology.<a name='FA_357' id='FA_357' href='#FN_357' class='fnanchor'>[357]</a> I can faintly trace its zigzag border of
sheeny pads even here. If such is then to be seen in remotest
wildernesses, does it not suggest its own nymphs
and wood gods to enjoy it? As when, at middle of the
placid noon in Indian-summer days, all the surface of
a lake is as one cobweb gleaming in the sun, which
heaves gently to the passing zephyr. There was the
lake, its glassy surface just distinguishable, its sheeny
shore of pads, with a few pines bathed in light on its
hither shore, just as in the middle of a November day,
except that this was the chaster light of the moon, the
cooler temperature of the night, and there were the
deep shades of night that fenced it round and imbosomed.
It tells of a far-away, long-passed civilization,
of an antiquity superior to time, unappreciable
by time.
</p>

<p>
Is there such virtue in raking cranberries that those
men’s industry whom I now see on the meadow shall
reprove my idleness? Can I not go over those same
meadows after them, and rake still more valuable fruits?
Can I not rake with my mind? Can I not rake a
thought, perchance, which shall be worth a bushel of
cranberries?
</p>

<p>
A certain refinement and civilization in nature which
increases with the wildness. The civilization that consists
with wildness, the light that is in night. A smile
as in a dream on the face of the sleeping lake. There
is light enough to show what we see, what <i>night</i> has to
exhibit. Any more would obscure these objects. I am
not advertised of any deficiency of light.<a name='FA_358' id='FA_358' href='#FN_358' class='fnanchor'>[358]</a> The actual
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' name='Page_478' href='#Page_478'>478</a></span>
is fair as a vision or a dream. If ever we have attained
to any nobleness, even in our imagination and intentions,
that will surely ennoble the features of nature
for us, that will clothe them with beauty. Of course no
jeweller ever dealt with a gem so fair and suggestive
as this actual lake, the scene, it may be, of so much
noble and poetic life, and not merely [to] adorn some
monarch’s crown.
</p>

<p>
It is remarkably still at this hour and season. No
sound of bird or beast for the most part. This has none
of the reputed noxious qualities of night.
</p>

<p>
On the peak. The faint sounds of birds, dreaming
aloud in the night, the fresh, cool air, and sound of the
wind rushing over the rocks remind me of the tops of
mountains. That is, all the earth is but the outside
of the planet bordering on the hard-eyed sky. Equally
withdrawn and near to heaven is this pasture as the
summit of the White Mountains. All the earth’s surface
like a mountain-top, for I see its relation to heaven
as simply, and am not imposed upon by a difference of
a few feet in elevation. In this faint, hoary light, all
fields are like a mossy rock and remote from the cultivated
plains of day. All is equally savage, equally
solitary and cool-aired, and the slight difference in
elevation is felt to be unimportant. It is all one with
Caucasus, the slightest hill pasture.
</p>

<p>
The basswood had a singularly solid look and
sharply defined, as by a web or film, as if its leaves
covered it like scales.

Scared up a whip-poor-will on the ground on the hill.
Will not my townsmen consider me a benefactor if

I conquer some realms from the night, if I can show
them that there is some beauty awake while they are
asleep, if I add to the domains of poetry,<a name='FA_359' id='FA_359' href='#FN_359' class='fnanchor'>[359]</a> if I report to
the gazettes anything transpiring in our midst worthy
of man’s attention? I will say nothing now to the disparagement
of Day, for he is not here to defend himself.
</p>

<p>
The northern lights now, as I descend from the
Conantum house, have become a crescent of light
crowned with short, shooting flames,—or the shadows
of flames, for sometimes they are dark as well as white.
There is scarcely any dew even in the low lands.
</p>

<p>
Now the fire in the north increases wonderfully,
not shooting up so much as creeping along, like a fire
on the mountains of the north seen afar in the night.
The Hyperborean gods are burning brush, and it
spread, and all the hoes in heaven couldn’t stop it.
It spread from west to east over the crescent hill. Like
a vast fiery worm it lay across the northern sky, broken
into many pieces; and each piece, with rainbow colors
skirting it, strove to advance itself toward the east,
worm-like, on its own annular muscles. It has spread
into their choicest wood-lots. Now it shoots up like a
single solitary watch-fire or burning bush, or where it
ran up a pine tree like powder, and still it continues
to gleam here and there like a fat stump in the burning,
and is reflected in the water. And now I see the gods
by great exertions have got it under, and the stars have
come out without fear, in peace.
</p>

<p>
Though no birds sing, the crickets vibrate their
shrill and stridulous cymbals, especially on the alders
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' name='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
of the causeway, those minstrels especially engaged

It takes some time to wear off the trivial impression
which the day has made, and thus the first hours of
night are sometimes lost.

There were two hen-hawks soared and circled for
our entertainment, when we were in the woods on that
Boon Plain the other day, crossing each other’s orbits
from time to time, alternating like the squirrels of the
morning, till, alarmed by our imitation of a hawk’s
shrill cry, they gradually inflated themselves, made
themselves more aerial, and rose higher and higher into
the heavens, and were at length lost to sight; yet all
the while earnestly looking, scanning the surface of the
earth for a stray mouse or rabbit.<a name='FA_361' id='FA_361' href='#FN_361' class='fnanchor'>[361]</a>

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept. 8.</i> No fog this morning. Shall I not have words
as fresh as my thoughts? Shall I use any other man’s
word? A genuine thought or feeling can find expression
for itself, if it have to invent hieroglyphics. It has
the universe for type-metal. It is for want of original
thought that one man’s style is like another’s.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Certainly the voice of no bird or beast can be compared
with that of man for true melody. All other sounds
seem to be hushed, as if their possessors were attending,
when the voice of man is heard in melody. The air
gladly bears the burden. It is infinitely significant.
Man only sings in concert. The bird’s song is a mere
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_481' name='Page_481' href='#Page_481'>481</a></span>
interjectional shout of joy; man’s a glorious expression
of the foundations of his joy.
</p>

<p>
Do not the song of birds and the fireflies go with the
grass? While the grass is fresh, the earth is in its vigor.
The greenness of the grass is the best symptom or evidence
of the earth’s youth or health. Perhaps it will be
found that when the grass ceases to be fresh and green,
or after June, the birds have ceased to sing, and that
the fireflies, too, no longer in <i>myriads</i> sparkle in the
meadows. Perhaps a history of the year would be a
history of the grass, or of a leaf, regarding the grass-blades
as leaves, for it is equally true that the leaves
soon lose their freshness and soundness, and become
the prey of insects and of drought. Plants commonly
soon cease to grow for the year, unless they may have
a fall growth, which is a kind of second spring. In the
feelings of the man, too, the year is already past, and
he looks forward to the coming winter. His occasional
rejuvenescence and faith in the current time is like the
aftermath, a scanty crop. The enterprise which he has
not already undertaken cannot be undertaken this year.
The period of youth is past. The year may be in its
summer, in its manhood, but it is no longer in the flower
of its age. It is a season of withering, of dust and heat,
a season of small fruits and trivial experiences. Summer
thus answers to manhood. But there is an aftermath
in early autumn, and some spring flowers bloom
again, followed by an Indian summer of finer atmosphere
and of a pensive beauty. May my life be not
destitute of its Indian summer, a season of fine and clear,
mild weather in which I may prolong my hunting before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_482' name='Page_482' href='#Page_482'>482</a></span>
the winter comes, when I may once more lie on the
ground with faith, as in spring, and even with more
serene confidence. And then I will [wrap the] drapery
of summer about me and lie down to pleasant dreams.
As one year passes into another through the medium of
winter, so does this our life pass into another through
the medium of death.

The tree-primrose and the dwarf ditto and epilobium
still. Locust is heard. <i>Aster amplexicaulis</i>, beautiful
blue, purplish blue (?), about twenty-four rayed.

<i>Sept. 9.</i> 2 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>—The moon not quite full. To Conantum
<i>via</i> road.
</p>

<p>
There is a low vapor in the meadows beyond the
depot, dense and white, though scarcely higher than
a man’s head, concealing the stems of the trees. I see
that the oaks, which are so dark and distinctly outlined,
are illumined by the moon on the opposite side. This
as I go up the back road. A few thin, ineffectual clouds
in the sky. I come out thus into the moonlit night,
where men are not, as if into a scenery anciently deserted
by men. The life of men is like a dream. It is
three thousand years since night has had possession.
Go forth and hear the crickets chirp at midnight. Hear
if their dynasty is not an ancient one and well founded.
I feel the antiquity of the night. She surely repossesses
herself of her realms, as if her dynasty were uninterrupted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_483' name='Page_483' href='#Page_483'>483</a></span>
or she had underlain the day. No sounds but
the steady creaking of crickets and the occasional crowing
of cocks.
</p>

<p>
I go by the farmer’s houses and barns, standing there
in the dim light under the trees, as if they lay at an
immense distance or under a veil. The farmer and his
oxen now all asleep. Not even a watch-dog awake.
The human slumbers. There is less of man in the
world.
</p>

<p>
The fog in the lowlands on the Corner road is never
still. It now advances and envelops me as I stand to
write these words, then clears away, with ever noiseless
step. It covers the meadows like a web. I hear the
clock strike three.
</p>

<p>
Now at the clayey bank. The light of Orion’s belt
seems to show traces of the blue day through which it
came to us. The sky at least is lighter on that side than
in the west, even about the moon. Even by night the sky
is blue and not black, for we see through the veil of
night into the distant atmosphere of day. I see to the
plains of the sun, where the sunbeams are revelling.
The cricket’s (?) song, on the alders of the causeway,
not quite so loud at this hour as at evening. The moon
is getting low. I hear a wagon cross one of the bridges
leading into the town. I see the moonlight at this hour
on a different side of objects. I smell the ripe apples
many rods off beyond the bridge. A sultry night; a thin
coat is enough.
</p>

<p>
On the first top of Conantum. I hear the farmer
harnessing his horse and starting for the distant market,
but no man harnesses himself, and starts for worthier
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' name='Page_484' href='#Page_484'>484</a></span>
enterprises. One cock-crow tells the whole story of the
farmer’s life. The moon is now sinking into clouds in
the horizon. I see the glow-worms deep in the grass by
the little brookside in midst of Conantum. The moon
shines dun and red. A solitary whip-poor-will sings.
</p>

<p>
The clock strikes four. A few dogs bark. A few more
wagons start for market, their faint rattling heard in
the distance. I hear my owl without a name; the murmur
of the slow-approaching freight-train, as far off,
perchance, as Waltham; and one early bird.
</p>

<p>
The round, red moon disappearing in the west. I
detect a whiteness in the east. Some dark, massive
clouds have come over from the west within the hour,
as if attracted by the approaching sun, and have arranged
themselves raywise about the eastern portal,
as if to bar his coming. They have moved suddenly
and almost unobservedly quite across the sky (which
before was clear) from west to east. No trumpet was
heard which marshalled and advanced these dark
masses of the west’s forces thus rapidly against the
coming day. Column after column the mighty west sent
forth across the sky while men slept, but all in vain.
</p>

<p>
The eastern horizon is now grown dun-colored,
showing where the advanced guard of the night are
already skirmishing with the vanguard of the sun,
a lurid light tingeing the atmosphere there, while a
dark-columned cloud hangs imminent over the broad
portal, untouched by the glare. Some bird flies over,
making a noise like the barking of a puppy.<a name='FA_362' id='FA_362' href='#FN_362' class='fnanchor'>[362]</a> It is yet so
dark that I have dropped my pencil and cannot find it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_485' name='Page_485' href='#Page_485'>485</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The sound of the cars is like that of a rushing wind.
They come on slowly. I thought at first a morning wind
was rising. And now (perchance at half-past four) I
hear the sound of some far-off factory-bell arousing
the operatives to their early labors. It sounds very
sweet here. It is very likely some factory which I have
never seen, in some valley which I have never visited;
yet now I hear this, which is its only matin bell, sweet
and inspiring as if it summoned holy men and maids
to worship and not factory girls and men to resume
their trivial toil, as if it were the summons of some
religious or even poetic community. My first impression
is that it is the matin bell of some holy community
who in a distant valley dwell, a band of spiritual knights,—thus
sounding far and wide, sweet and sonorous, in
harmony with their own morning thoughts. What else
could I suppose fitting this earth and hour? Some man
of high resolve, devoted soul, has touched the rope;
and by its peals how many men and maids are waked
from peaceful slumbers to fragrant morning thoughts!
Why should I fear to tell that it is Knight’s factory-bell
at Assabet? A few melodious peals and all is still
again.
</p>

<p>
The whip-poor-wills now begin to sing in earnest
about half an hour before sunrise, as if making haste
to improve the short time that is left them. As far as
my observation goes, they sing for several hours in the
early part of the night, are silent commonly at midnight,—though
you may meet [them] then sitting on a rock
or flitting silently about,—then sing again just before
sunrise. It grows more and more red in the east—a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_486' name='Page_486' href='#Page_486'>486</a></span>
fine-grained red under the overhanging cloud—and
lighter too, and the threatening clouds are falling off to
southward of the sun’s passage, shrunken and defeated,
leaving his path comparatively clear. The increased
light shows more distinctly the river and the fog.
</p>

<p>
5 o’clock.—The light now reveals a thin film of vapor
like a gossamer veil cast over the lower hills beneath
the Cliffs and stretching to the river, thicker in the
ravines, thinnest on the even slopes. The distant
meadows towards the north beyond Conant’s Grove,
full of fog, appear like a vast lake out of which rise
Annursnack and Ponkawtasset like rounded islands.
Nawshawtuct is a low and wooded isle, scarcely seen
above the waves. The heavens are now clear again. The
vapor, which was confined to the river and meadows,
now rises and creeps up the sides of the hills. I see it in
transparent columns advancing down the valley of the
river, ghost-like, from Fair Haven, and investing some
wooded or rocky promontory, before free. So ghosts
are said to advance.
</p>

<p>
Annursnack is exactly like some round, steep, distant
hill on the opposite shore of a large lake (and Tabor
on the other side), with here and there some low Brush
Island in middle of the waves (the tops of some oaks
or elms). Oh, what a sail I could take, if I had the right
kind of bark, over to Annursnack! for there she lies four
miles from land as sailors say. And all the farms and
houses of Concord are at bottom of that sea. So I forget
them, and my thought sails triumphantly over them.
As I looked down where the village of Concord lay
buried in fog, I thought of nothing but the surface of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_487' name='Page_487' href='#Page_487'>487</a></span>
a lake, a summer sea over which to sail; no more than a
voyager on the Dead Sea who had not read the Testament
would think of Sodom and Gomorrah, once cities
of the plain. I only wished to get off to one of the low
isles I saw in midst of the [sea] (it may have been the
top of Holbrook’s elm), and spend the whole summer
day there.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the redness in the east had diminished
and was less deep. (The fog over some meadows looked
green.) I went down to Tupelo Cliff to bathe. A great
bittern, which I had scared, flew heavily across the
stream. The redness had risen at length above the dark
cloud, the sun approaching. And next the redness became
a sort of yellowish or fawn-colored light, and the
sun now set fire to the edges of the broken cloud which
had hung over the horizon, and they glowed like burning
turf.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<i>Sept. 10.</i> As I watch the groves on the meadow
opposite our house, I see how differently they look at
different hours of the day, <i>i. e.</i> in different lights,
when the sun shines on them variously. In the morning,
perchance, they seem one blended mass of light green.
In the afternoon, distinct trees appear, separated by
heavy shadows, and in some places I can see quite
through the grove.
</p>

<p>
3 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—To the Cliffs and the Grape Cliff beyond.
</p>

<p>
Hardhack and meadow-sweet are now all dry. I see
the smoke of burning brush in the west horizon this
dry and sultry afternoon, and wish to look off from
some hill. It is a kind of work the farmer cannot do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_488' name='Page_488' href='#Page_488'>488</a></span>
without discovery. Sometimes I smell these smokes
several miles off, and by the odor know it is not a burning
building, but withered leaves and the rubbish of the
woods and swamp. As I go through the woods, I see
that the ferns have turned brown and give the woods
an autumnal look. The boiling spring is almost completely
dry. Nothing flows (I mean without the shed),
but there are many hornets and yellow wasps apparently
buzzing and circling about in jealousy of one another,
either drinking the stagnant water, which is the
most accessible this dry parching day, or it may be collecting
something from the slime,—I think the former.
</p>

<p>
As I go up Fair Haven Hill, I see some signs of the
approaching fall of the white pine. On some trees the
old leaves are already somewhat reddish, though not
enough to give the trees a parti-colored look, and they
come off easily on being touched,—the old leaves on
the lower part of the twigs.
</p>

<p>
Some farmers are sowing their winter rye? I see the
fields smoothly rolled. (I hear the locust still.) I see
others plowing steep rocky and bushy fields, apparently
for the same purpose. How beautiful the sprout-land
(burnt plain) seen from the Cliff! No more cheering
and inspiring sight than a young wood springing
up thus over a large tract, when you look down on it,
the light green of the maples shaded off into the darker
oaks; and here and there a maple blushes quite red, enlivening
the scene yet more. Surely this earth is fit to
be inhabited, and many enterprises may be undertaken
with hope where so many young plants are pushing up.
In the spring I burned over a hundred acres till the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' name='Page_489' href='#Page_489'>489</a></span>
earth was sere and black, and by midsummer this space
was clad in a fresher and more luxuriant green than
the surrounding even. Shall man then despair? Is he
not a sprout-land too, after never so many searings and
witherings?<a name='FA_363' id='FA_363' href='#FN_363' class='fnanchor'>[363]</a> If you witness growth and luxuriance,
it is all the same as if you grew luxuriantly.
</p>

<p>
I see three smokes in Stow. One sends up dark
volumes of wreathed smoke, as if from the mouth of
Erebus. It is remarkable what effects so thin and subtile
a substance as smoke produces, even at a distance,—dark
and heavy and powerful as rocks at a distance.
</p>

<p>
The woodbine is red on the rocks.
</p>

<p>
The poke is a very rich and striking plant. Some
which stand under the Cliffs quite dazzled me with
their now purple stems gracefully drooping each way,
their rich, somewhat yellowish, purple-veined leaves, their
bright purple racemes,—peduncles, and pedicels, and
calyx-like petals from which the birds have picked the
berries (these racemes, with their petals now turned to
purple, are more brilliant than anything of the kind),—flower-buds,
flowers, ripe berries and dark purple ones,
and calyx-like petals which have lost their fruit, all on
the same plant. I love to see any redness in the vegetation
of the temperate zone. It is the richest color. I love
to press these berries between my fingers and see their
rich purple wine staining my hand. It asks a bright sun
on it to make it show to best advantage, and it must be
seen at this season of the year. It speaks to my blood.
Every part of it is flower, such is its superfluity of color,—a
feast of color. That is the richest flower which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' name='Page_490' href='#Page_490'>490</a></span>
most abounds in color. What need to taste the fruit,
to drink the wine, to him who can thus taste and drink
with his eyes? Its boughs, gracefully drooping, offering
repasts to the birds. It is cardinal in its rank, as in its
color. Nature here is full of blood and heat and luxuriance.
What a triumph it appears in Nature to have
produced and perfected such a plant,—as if this were
enough for a summer.<a name='FA_364' id='FA_364' href='#FN_364' class='fnanchor'>[364]</a>
</p>

<p>
The downy seeds of the groundsel are taking their
flight here. The calyx has dismissed them and quite
curled back, having done its part. <i>Lespedeza sessiliflora</i>,
or reticulated lespedeza on the Cliffs now out of
bloom. At the Grape Cliff, the few bright-red leaves
of the tupelo contrast with the polished green ones.
The tupelos with drooping branches.
</p>

<p>
The grape-vines overrunning and bending down the
maples form little arching bowers over the meadow,
five or six feet in diameter, like parasols held over
the ladies of the harem, in the East. <i>Cuscuta Americana</i>,
or dodder, in blossom still. The <i>Desmodium
paniculatum</i> of De Candolle and Gray (<i>Hedysarum

<i>Sept. 11.</i> Every artisan learns positively something
by his trade. Each craft is familiar with a few simple,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_491' name='Page_491' href='#Page_491'>491</a></span>
well-known, well-established facts, not requiring any
genius to discover, but mere use and familiarity. You
may go by the man at his work in the street every day
of your life, and though he is there before you, carrying
into practice certain essential information, you shall
never be the wiser. Each trade is in fact a craft, a cunning,
a covering an ability; and its methods are the
result of a long experience. There sits a stone-mason,
splitting Westford granite for fence-posts. Egypt has
perchance taught New England something in this matter.
His hammer, his chisels, his wedges, his shims
or half-rounds, his iron spoon,—I suspect that these
tools are hoary with age as with granite dust. He learns
as easily where the best granite comes from as he learns
how to erect that screen to keep off the sun. He knows
that he can drill faster into a large stone than a small
one, because there is less jar and yielding. He deals
in stone as the carpenter in lumber. In many of his
operations only the materials are different. His work
is slow and expensive. Nature is here hard to be overcome.
He wears up one or two drills in splitting a single
stone. He must sharpen his tools oftener than the carpenter.
He fights with granite. He knows the temper
of the rocks. He grows stony himself. His tread is ponderous
and steady like the fall of a rock. And yet by
patience and art he splits a stone as surely as the carpenter
or woodcutter a log. So much time and perseverance
will accomplish. One would say that mankind
had much less moral than physical energy, that any
day you see men following the trade of splitting rocks,
who yet shrink from undertaking apparently less
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' name='Page_492' href='#Page_492'>492</a></span>
arduous moral labors, the solving of moral problems.
See how surely he proceeds. He does not hesitate to
drill a dozen holes, each one the labor of a day or two
for a savage; he carefully takes out the dust with his
iron spoon; he inserts his wedges, one in each hole, and
protects the sides of the holes and gives resistance to his
wedges by thin pieces of half-round iron (or shims); he
marks the red line which he has drawn, with his chisel,
carefully cutting it straight; and then how carefully he
drives each wedge in succession, fearful lest he should
not have a good split!
</p>

<p>
The habit of looking at men in the gross makes their
lives have less of human interest for us. But though
there are crowds of laborers before us, yet each one
leads his little epic life each day. There is the stone-mason,
who, methought, was simply a stony man that
hammered stone from breakfast to dinner, and dinner
to supper, and then went to his slumbers. But he, I
find, is even a man like myself, for he feels the heat of
the sun and has raised some boards on a frame to protect
him. And now, at mid-forenoon, I see his wife and
child have come and brought him drink and meat for
his lunch and to assuage the stoniness of his labor, and
sit to chat with him.
</p>

<p>
There are many rocks lying there for him to split
from end to end, and he will surely do it. This only at
the command of luxury, since stone posts are preferred
to wood. But how many moral blocks are lying there
in every man’s yard, which he surely will not split nor
earnestly endeavor to split. There lie the blocks which
will surely get split, but here lie the blocks which will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' name='Page_493' href='#Page_493'>493</a></span>
surely not get split. Do we say it is too hard for human
faculties? But does not the mason dull a basketful
of steel chisels in a day, and yet, by sharpening them
again and tempering them aright, succeed? Moral
effort! Difficulty to be overcome!!! Why, men work
in stone, and sharpen their drills when they go home
to dinner!

Why should Canada, wild and unsettled as it is,
impress one as an older country than the States, except
that her institutions are old. All things seem to contend
there with a certain rust of antiquity, such as forms
on old armor and iron guns, the rust of conventions and
formalities. If the rust was not on the tinned roofs and
spires, it was on the inhabitants.<a name='FA_366' id='FA_366' href='#FN_366' class='fnanchor'>[366]</a>

<p>
The skunk-cabbage’s checkered fruit (spadix), one
three inches long; all parts of the flower but the anthers
left and enlarged. <i>Bidens cernua</i>, or nodding burr-marigold,
like a small sunflower (with rays) in Heywood
Brook, <i>i. e.</i> beggar-tick. <i>Bidens connata</i> (?),
without rays, in Hubbard’s Meadow. Blue-eyed grass
still. Drooping neottia very common. I see some yellow
butterflies and others occasionally and singly only.
The smilax berries are mostly turned dark. I started
a great bittern from the weeds at the swimming-place.
</p>

<p>
It is very hot and dry weather. We have had no rain
for a week, and yet the pitcher-plants have water in
them. Are they ever quite dry? Are they not replenished
by the dews always, and, being shaded by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' name='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
grass, saved from evaporation? What wells for the
birds!

<p>
The white-red-purple-berried bush in Hubbard’s
Meadow, whose berries were fairest a fortnight ago,
appears to be the <i>Viburnum nudum</i>, or withe-rod. Our
cornel (the common) with berries blue one side, whitish
the other, appears to be either the <i>Cornus sericea</i> or
<i>C. stolonifera</i> of Gray, <i>i. e.</i> the silky, or the red-osier
cornel (<i>osier rouge</i>), though its leaves are neither silky
nor downy nor rough.

Like knight, like esquire. When Benvenuto Cellini
was attacked by the constables in Rome, his boy Cencio
assisted him, or at least stood by, and afterward related
his master’s exploits; “and as they asked him several
times whether he had been afraid, he answered that
they should propose the question to me, for he had been
affected upon the occasion just in the same manner
that I was.”
</p>

<p>
Benvenuto Cellini relates in his memoirs that, during
his confinement in the castle of St. Angelo in Rome, he
had a terrible dream or vision in which certain events
were communicated to him which afterward came to
pass, and he adds: “From the very moment that I
beheld the phenomenon, there appeared (strange to relate!)
a resplendent light over my head, which has displayed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_495' name='Page_495' href='#Page_495'>495</a></span>
itself conspicuously to all that I have thought
proper to show it to, but those were very few. This
shining light is to be seen in the morning over my
shadow till two o’clock in the afternoon, and it appears
to the greatest advantage when the grass is moist with
dew: it is likewise visible in the evening at sunset. This
phenomenon I took notice of when I was at Paris, because
the air is exceedingly clear in that climate, so that
I could distinguish it there much plainer than in Italy,
where mists are much more frequent; but I can still see
it even here, and show it to others, though not to the
same advantage as in France.” This reminds me of the
halo around my shadow which I notice from the causeway
in the morning,—also by moonlight,—as if, in
the case of a man of an excitable imagination, this were
basis enough for his superstition.<a name='FA_367' id='FA_367' href='#FN_367' class='fnanchor'>[367]</a>
</p>

<p>
After I have spent the greater part of a night abroad
in the moonlight, I am obliged to sleep enough more
the next night to make up for it,—<i>Endymionis somnum
dormire</i> (to sleep an Endymion sleep), as the ancients
expressed it.<a name='FA_368' id='FA_368' href='#FN_368' class='fnanchor'>[368]</a> And there is something gained still
by thus turning the day into night. Endymion is said
to have obtained of Jupiter the privilege of sleeping as
much as he would. Let no man be afraid of sleep, if
his weariness comes of obeying his Genius. He who
has spent the night with the gods sleeps more innocently
by day than the sluggard who has spent the day with
the satyrs sleeps by night. He who has travelled to
fairyland in the night sleeps by day more innocently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_496' name='Page_496' href='#Page_496'>496</a></span>
than he who is fatigued by the merely trivial labors
of the day sleeps by night. That kind of life which,
sleeping, we dream that we live awake, in our walks by
night, we, waking, live, while our daily life appears as a
dream.

<p class="p2">
2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>—To the Three Friends’ Hill beyond Flint’s
Pond, <i>via</i> railroad, R. W. E.’s wood-path south side
Walden, George Heywood’s cleared lot, and Smith’s
orchard; return <i>via</i> east of Flint’s Pond, <i>via</i> Goose
Pond and my old home to railroad.
</p>

<p>
I go to Flint’s Pond for the sake of the mountain view
from the hill beyond, looking over Concord. I have
thought it the best, especially in the winter, which I can
get in this neighborhood. It is worth the while to see
the mountains in the horizon once a day. I have thus
seen some earth which corresponds to my least earthly
and trivial, to my most heavenward-looking, thoughts.
The earth seen through an azure, an ethereal, veil. They
are the natural <i>temples</i>, elevated brows, of the earth,
looking at which, the thoughts of the beholder are naturally
elevated and sublimed,—etherealized. I wish
to see the earth through the medium of much air or
heaven, for there is no paint like the air. Mountains
thus seen are worthy of worship. I go to Flint’s Pond
also to see a rippling lake and a reedy island in its midst,—Reed
Island. A man should feed his senses with the
best that the land affords.<a name='FA_369' id='FA_369' href='#FN_369' class='fnanchor'>[369]</a>
</p>

<p>
At the entrance to the Deep Cut, I heard the telegraph-wire
vibrating like an æolian harp. It reminded
me suddenly,—reservedly, with a beautiful paucity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' name='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
of communication, even silently, such was its effect on
my thoughts,—it reminded me, I say, with a certain
pathetic moderation, of what finer and deeper stirrings
I was susceptible, which grandly set all argument and
dispute aside, a triumphant though transient exhibition
of the truth. It told me by the faintest imaginable
strain, it told me by the finest strain that a human ear
can hear, yet conclusively and past all refutation, that
there were higher, infinitely higher, planes of life which
it behooved me never to forget. As I was entering the
Deep Cut, the wind, which was conveying a message to
me from heaven, dropped it on the wire of the telegraph
which it vibrated as it passed. I instantly sat
down on a stone at the foot of the telegraph-pole, and
attended to the communication. It merely said: “Bear
in mind, Child, and never for an instant forget, that
there are higher planes, infinitely higher planes, of life
than this thou art now travelling on. Know that the goal
is distant, and is upward, and is worthy all your life’s
efforts to attain to.” And then it ceased, and though
I sat some minutes longer I heard nothing more.
</p>

<p>
There is every variety and degree of inspiration
from mere fullness of life to the most rapt mood. A
human soul is played on even as this wire, which now
vibrates slowly and gently so that the passer can hardly
hear it, and anon the sound swells and vibrates with
such intensity as if it would rend the wire, as far as the
elasticity and tension of the wire permits, and now it
dies away and is silent, and though the breeze continues
to sweep over it, no strain comes from it, and the
traveller hearkens in vain. It is no small gain to have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' name='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
this wire stretched through Concord, though there may
be no office here. Thus I make my own use of the telegraph,
without consulting the directors, like the sparrows,
which I perceive use it extensively for a perch.
Shall I not go to this office to hear if there is any communication
for me, as steadily as to the post-office in
the village?<a name='FA_370' id='FA_370' href='#FN_370' class='fnanchor'>[370]</a>

I can hardly believe that there is so great a difference
between one year and another as my journal shows.
The 11th of this month last year, the river was as high
as it commonly is in the spring, over the causeway on
the Corner road. It is now quite low. Last year, October
9th, the huckleberries were fresh and abundant on
Conantum. They are now already dried up.
</p>

<p>
We yearn to see the mountains daily, as the Israelites
yearned for the promised land, and we daily live the
fate of Moses, who only looked into the promised land
from Pisgah before he died.
</p>

<p>
On Monday, the 15th instant, I am going to perambulate
the bounds of the town. As I am partial to
across-lot routes, this appears to be a very proper duty
for me to perform, for certainly no route can well be
chosen which shall be more across-lot, since the roads
in no case run round the town but ray out from its centre,
and my course will lie across each one. It is almost
as if I had undertaken to walk round the town at the
greatest distance from its centre and at the same time
from the surrounding villages. There is no public house
near the line. It is a sort of reconnoissance of its frontiers
authorized by the central government of the town,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' name='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
which will bring the surveyor in contact with whatever
wild inhabitant or wilderness its territory embraces.
</p>

<p>
This appears to be a very ancient custom, and I find
that this word “perambulation” has exactly the same
meaning that it has at present in Johnson and Walker’s
dictionary. A hundred years ago they went round the
towns of this State every three years. And the old
selectmen tell me that, before the present split stones
were set up in 1829, the bounds were marked by a heap
of stones, and it was customary for each selectman to add
a stone to the heap.
</p>

<p>
Saw a pigeon-place on George Heywood’s cleared
lot,—the six dead trees set up for the pigeons to alight
on, and the brush house close by to conceal the man.
I was rather startled to find such a thing going now in
Concord. The pigeons on the trees looked like fabulous
birds with their long tails and their pointed breasts.
I could hardly believe they were alive and not some
wooden birds used for decoys, they sat so still; and,
even when they moved their necks, I thought it was
the effect of art. As they were not catching then, I
approached and scared away a dozen birds who were
perched on the trees, and found that they were freshly
baited there, though the net was carried away, perchance
to some other bed. The smooth sandy bed was
covered with buckwheat, wheat or rye, and acorns.
Sometimes they use corn, shaved off the ear in its present
state with a knife. There were left the sticks with
which they fastened the nets. As I stood there, I heard
a rushing sound and, looking up, saw a flock of thirty
or forty pigeons dashing toward the <i>trees</i>, who suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' name='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
whirled on seeing me and circled round and made a new
dash toward the bed, as if they would fain alight if I
had not been there, then steered off. I crawled into the
bough house and lay awhile looking through the leaves,
hoping to see them come again and feed, but they did
not while I stayed. This net and bed belong to one
Harrington of Weston, as I hear. Several men still take
pigeons in Concord every year; by a method, methinks,
extremely old and which I seem to have seen pictured
in some old book of fables or symbols, and yet few in
Concord know exactly how it is done. And yet it is
all done for money and because the birds fetch a good
price, just as the farmers raise corn and potatoes. I am
always expecting that those engaged in such a pursuit
will be somewhat less grovelling and mercenary than
the regular trader or farmer, but I fear that it is not
so.
</p>

<p>
Found a violet, apparently <i>Viola cucullata</i>, or hood-leaved
violet, in bloom in Baker’s Meadow beyond
Pine Hill; also the <i>Bidens cernua</i>, nodding burr-marigold,
with five petals, in same place. Went through the
old corn-field on the hillside beyond, now grown up to
birches and hickories,—woods where you feel the old
corn-hills under your feet; for these, not being disturbed
or levelled in getting the crop, like potato-hills,
last an indefinite while; and by some they are called
Indian corn-fields, though I think erroneously, not only
from their position in rocky soil frequently, but because
the squaws probably, with their clamshells or thin
stones or wooden hoes, did not hill their corn more than
many now recommend.

What we call woodbine is the <i>Vitis hederacea</i>, or

When I got into the Lincoln road, I perceived a singular
sweet scent in the air, which I suspected arose
from some plant now in a peculiar state owing to the
season, but though I smelled everything around, I could
not detect it, but the more eagerly I smelled, the further
I seemed to be from finding it; but when I gave up
the search, again it would be wafted to me. It was one
of the sweet scents which go to make the autumn air,
which fed my sense of smell rarely and dilated my
nostrils. I felt the better for it. Methinks that I possess
the sense of smell in greater perfection than usual,
and have the habit of smelling of every plant I pluck.
How autumnal is the scent of ripe grapes now by the
roadside!<a name='FA_371' id='FA_371' href='#FN_371' class='fnanchor'>[371]</a>

<p>
From the pond-side hill I perceive that the forest
leaves begin to look rather rusty or brown. The pendulous,
drooping barberries are pretty well reddened.
I am glad when the berries look fair and plump. I love
to gaze at the low island in the pond,—at any island
or inaccessible land. The isle at which you look always
seems fairer than the mainland on which you stand.
</p>

<p>
I had already bathed in Walden as I passed, but now
I forgot that I had been wetted, and wanted to embrace
and mingle myself with the water of Flint’s Pond this
warm afternoon, to get wet inwardly and deeply.
</p>

<p>
Found on the shore of the pond that singular willow-like
herb in blossom, though its petals were gone. It
grows up two feet from a large woody horizontal root,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_502' name='Page_502' href='#Page_502'>502</a></span>
and droops over to the sand again, meeting which, it puts
out a myriad rootlets from the side of its stem, fastens
itself, and curves upward again to the air, thus spanning
or looping itself along. The bark just above the ground
thickens into a singular cellular or spongy substance,
which at length appears to crack nearer the earth, giving
that part of the plant a winged and somewhat four-sided
appearance. It appears to be the cellular tissue,
or what is commonly called the green bark, and likewise
invests the root to a great thickness, somewhat like
a fungus, and is of a fawn-color. The <i>Lythrum verticillatum</i>,
or swamp loosestrife, or grass poly, but I think
better named, as in Dewey, swamp-willow-herb.
</p>

<p>
The prinos berries are pretty red. Any redness like
cardinal-flowers, or poke, or the evening sky, or cheronæa,
excites us as a red flag does cows and turkeys.

Here is a morning after a warm, clear, moonlight
night almost entirely without dew or fog. It has been
a little breezy through the night, it is true; but why
so great a difference between this and other mornings
of late? I can walk in any direction in the fields without
wetting my feet.
</p>

<p>
I see the same rays in the dun, buff, or fawn-colored
sky now, just twenty minutes before sunrise, though
they do not extend quite so far as at sundown the other
night. Why these rays? What is it divides the light of
the sun? Is it thus divided by distant inequalities in
the surface of the earth, behind which the other parts
are concealed, and since the morning atmosphere is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_503' name='Page_503' href='#Page_503'>503</a></span>
clearer they do not reach so far? Some small island
clouds are the first to look red.
</p>

<p>
The cross-leaved polygala emits its fragrance as if
at will. You are quite sure you smelled it and are
ravished with its sweet fragrance, but now it has no
smell. You must not hold it too near, but hold it on all
sides and at all distances, and there will perchance be
wafted to you sooner or later a very sweet and penetrating
fragrance. What it is like you cannot surely tell,
for you do not enjoy it long enough nor in volume
enough to compare it. It is very likely that you will not
discover any fragrance while you are rudely smelling
at it; you can only remember that you once perceived
it. Both this and the caducous polygala are now somewhat
faded.
</p>

<p>
Now the sun is risen. The sky is almost perfectly
clear this morning; not a cloud in the horizon. The
morning is not pensive like the evening, but joyous and
youthful, and its blush is soon gone. It is unfallen
day. The Bedford sunrise bell rings sweetly and musically
at this hour, when there is no bustle in the village
to drown it. Bedford deserves a vote of thanks from
Concord for it. It is a great good at these still and
sacred hours, when towns can hear each other. It would
be nought at noon.

The dry grass yields a crisped sound to my feet. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' name='Page_504' href='#Page_504'>504</a></span>
white oak which appears to have made part of a hedge
fence once, now standing in Hubbard’s fence near the
Corner road, where it stretches along horizontally,
is (one of its arms, for it has one running each way)
two and a half feet thick, with a sprout growing perpendicularly
out of it eighteen inches in diameter. The
corn-stalks standing in stacks, in long rows along the
edges of the corn-fields, remind me of stacks of muskets.
</p>

<p>
As soon as berries are gone, grapes come. The
chalices of the <i>Rhexia Virginica</i>, deer-grass or meadow-beauty,
are literally little reddish chalices now, though
many still have petals,— <img src="images/i-543.jpg" width="34" height="44" alt="Pitcher" /> little cream pitchers.<a name='FA_372' id='FA_372' href='#FN_372' class='fnanchor'>[372]</a>
The caducous polygala in cool places is faded almost
white. I see the river at the foot of Fair Haven
Hill running up-stream before the strong cool wind,
which here strikes it from the north. The cold wind
makes me shudder after my bath, before I get dressed.

Commenced perambulating the town bounds. At
7.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> rode in company with —— and Mr. —— to
the bound between Acton and Concord near Paul Dudley’s.
Mr. —— told a story of his wife walking in the
fields somewhere, and, to keep the rain off, throwing her
gown over her head and holding it in her mouth, and
so being poisoned about her mouth from the skirts of
her dress having come in contact with poisonous plants.

At Dudley’s, which house is handsomely situated, with
five large elms in front, we met the selectmen of Acton,
—— —— and —— ——. Here were five of us. It appeared
that we weighed, — —— I think about 160,
—— 155, —— about 140, —— 130, myself 127. ——
described the wall about or at Forest Hills Cemetery
in Roxbury as being made of stones upon which they
were careful to preserve the moss, so that it cannot be
distinguished from a very old wall.

Found one intermediate bound-stone near the powder-mill
drying-house on the bank of the river. The workmen
there wore shoes without iron tacks. He said that
the kernel-house was the most dangerous, the drying-house
next, the press-house next. One of the powder-mill
buildings in Concord? The potato vines and the
beans which were still green are now blackened and
flattened by the frost.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
